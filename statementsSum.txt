V The System was originally developed for use in the Australian market by a company called Banner Trading Systems Property Limited (Banner), controlled by Mr Day, who gave evidence. Mr Day is now resident in Vanuatu, and has a new family company, DMT International Limited (DMT), which has recently taken over the assets and activities of Banner. The precise status of either company, and the detail of the transactions between them, are not entirely clear from the evidence before me, but are probably not material to the issues I have to decide. There seems no reason to doubt that Mr Day, through one or other of his companies, was able to, and did, confer the necessary rights on Market Wizard UK.  \u000a
p1
aV I will deal with these two issues together because they are linked and they can be dealt with shortly. The company's duty under section 221 of the Companies Act 1985 was to keep accounting records sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions, and such as to disclose with a reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the company at that time. The precise state of the company's affairs is impossible to ascertain from the documents before me. There are various different sets of accounts at different dates, but Mr Ashe, for the company, does not claim that any of them represent a complete or reliable statement of the company's affairs.\u000a

aV The company continued to trade until the appointment of a provisional liquidator on 5th March. By that time sales of over 70 systems had been sold to the value of over 400,000. Following his appointment, the Official Receiver wrote to each of the 76 licence holders notifying them of his appointment. As at 16th June he had received nine responses, four of which were acknowledgements, two expressed dissatisfaction with the System or the methods by which it had been promoted, and three expressed dissatisfaction at the action taken by the DTI. One result of the appointment of a provisional liquidator was that the company ceased to be able to provide its updating service or the daily price data. This led to some complaints from those who were happy with the product, but were now prevented from using it as intended. \u000a

aV The ASC served statutory notices on WSA in September 1996 requiring information. This was followed by discussions of the prescribed warnings which would be required if the ASC was to issue a no action letter. These negotiations did not proceed, apparently because the ASC was involved in other litigation in the Australian Federal Court raising similar issues. Further statutory notices were served on WSA in December 1997 and March 1998 seeking further information, and a demonstration of the System took place at WSA's offices on 15th April 1998. According to the ASC's letter of 8th May, the information is currently being reviewed.\u000a

aV Mr Ashe, for the company, submitted that the System is simply a matter of calculation based on historical data and the updates put in by the customer. He described it as a sophisticated and technologically based 'calculator'. This submission would have some substance if all the programme purported to do was to provide a convenient means of extracting and analysing data as to historical movements in the market, without offering any interpretation of that information as a guide to future action. But such a limited function would be quite inconsistent with the sense of the brochure and the evidence of Mr Day. The whole purpose of the programme, as explained by Mr Day, is to reproduce in computer programme form the concepts developed by legendary market forecasters relating to the use of parabolas in determining the future direction of market price. The part of the brochure dealing with the guarantee describes the System as a medium to long term investment strategy. To qualify for the guarantee the user has to show that he has followed the signals provided by the programme during the 12 month period. That requirement can only make sense if the signals are intended to guide the strategy. \u000a

aVThere must be an element of decision making, which affects the corporate enterprise as a whole, but those responsible need not form part of the board, nor even need they be executives directly communicating with the board. Nevertheless, in the ordinary course of affairs, it is only in a large company that a person outside this latter category, so far removed from the power of control exercised by the directors, may be engaged in the 'management' of a company. In a small company like the present the actions of those directly answerable to the directors may amount to 'management', for, even if those people are also engaged in routine activities of the kind not normally associated with management, it is sufficient if powers and functions are delegated to those persons which are likely in their performance to have a significant effect on the business and financial standing of the company. As it is a protective section, protective at least to the creditors and shareholders, it must have been designed to prevent the participation in management of those who might put the solvency or the probity of the corporation's administration at risk. Persons not given any significant discretion or advisory role in decision making could not therefore be intended as an object of the prohibition. It may be difficult to draw the line in particular cases, but in my opinion the concept of 'management' for present purposes, comprehends activities which involve policy and decision making, related to the business affairs of a corporation, affecting the corporation as a whole or a substantial part of that corporation, to the extent that the consequences of the formation of those policies or the making of those decisions may have some significant bearing on the financial standing of the corporation or the conduct of its affairs.

The company's duty under section 221 of the Companies Act 1985 was to keep accounting records sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions, and such as to disclose with a reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the company at that time. The precise state of the company's affairs is impossible to ascertain from the documents before me. There are various different sets of accounts at different dates, but Mr Ashe, for the company, does not claim that any of them represent a complete or reliable statement of the company's affairs.\u000a

aV Like Harman J, I have no doubt that the signals generated by the use of the System constitute the kind of advice with which paragraph 15 is concerned. The signals provide guidance as to the course of action which the user should take in relation to the buying or selling of the investments. Such guidance, in the ordinary use of English, is advice on the merits of purchasing those investments. It matters not that the user is free to follow or disregard the advice; nor that he may receive further advice from his broker before making a final decision. The brochure itself describes what is offered as critical guidance when you need to make intelligent, disciplined trading decision.... Similarly, the user manual (p3) describes Market Wizard as a computerised trading tool that generates detailed trading advice for a specific range of exchange traded securities. Those appear to be entirely accurate descriptions of what the programme purports to do. \u000a

aVThere must be an element of decision making, which affects the corporate enterprise as a whole, but those responsible need not form part of the board, nor even need they be executives directly communicating with the board. Nevertheless, in the ordinary course of affairs, it is only in a large company that a person outside this latter category, so far removed from the power of control exercised by the directors, may be engaged in the 'management' of a company. In a small company like the present the actions of those directly answerable to the directors may amount to 'management', for, even if those people are also engaged in routine activities of the kind not normally associated with management, it is sufficient if powers and functions are delegated to those persons which are likely in their performance to have a significant effect on the business and financial standing of the company. As it is a protective section, protective at least to the creditors and shareholders, it must have been designed to prevent the participation in management of those who might put the solvency or the probity of the corporation's administration at risk. Persons not given any significant discretion or advisory role in decision making could not therefore be intended as an object of the prohibition. It may be difficult to draw the line in particular cases, but in my opinion the concept of 'management' for present purposes, comprehends activities which involve policy and decision making, related to the business affairs of a corporation, affecting the corporation as a whole or a substantial part of that corporation, to the extent that the consequences of the formation of those policies or the making of those decisions may have some significant bearing on the financial standing of the corporation or the conduct of its affairs.

aV The System was originally developed for use in the Australian market by a company called Banner Trading Systems Property Limited (Banner), controlled by Mr Day, who gave evidence. Mr Day is now resident in Vanuatu, and has a new family company, DMT International Limited (DMT), which has recently taken over the assets and activities of Banner. The precise status of either company, and the detail of the transactions between them, are not entirely clear from the evidence before me, but are probably not material to the issues I have to decide. There seems no reason to doubt that Mr Day, through one or other of his companies, was able to, and did, confer the necessary rights on Market Wizard UK.  \u000a

aV The company continued to trade until the appointment of a provisional liquidator on 5th March. By that time sales of over 70 systems had been sold to the value of over 400,000. Following his appointment, the Official Receiver wrote to each of the 76 licence holders notifying them of his appointment. As at 16th June he had received nine responses, four of which were acknowledgements, two expressed dissatisfaction with the System or the methods by which it had been promoted, and three expressed dissatisfaction at the action taken by the DTI. One result of the appointment of a provisional liquidator was that the company ceased to be able to provide its updating service or the daily price data. This led to some complaints from those who were happy with the product, but were now prevented from using it as intended. \u000a

aV Mr Ashe, for the company, submitted that the System is simply a matter of calculation based on historical data and the updates put in by the customer. He described it as a sophisticated and technologically based 'calculator'. This submission would have some substance if all the programme purported to do was to provide a convenient means of extracting and analysing data as to historical movements in the market, without offering any interpretation of that information as a guide to future action. But such a limited function would be quite inconsistent with the sense of the brochure and the evidence of Mr Day. The whole purpose of the programme, as explained by Mr Day, is to reproduce in computer programme form the concepts developed by legendary market forecasters relating to the use of parabolas in determining the future direction of market price. The part of the brochure dealing with the guarantee describes the System as a medium to long term investment strategy. To qualify for the guarantee the user has to show that he has followed the signals provided by the programme during the 12 month period. That requirement can only make sense if the signals are intended to guide the strategy. \u000a

aV There is a separate question as to the extent to which the company should be held responsible for the breach of section 11. Although I accept that Mr Smith did not himself know of Mr Reichelt's bankrupt status, or of its consequences under section 11, he was aware of Comstrad's dubious activities and the fact that it had been closed down pursuant to Court action. Indeed, he believed that they had pinched some of his own publicity material. Yet it was to Mr Wade, Mr Reichelt and Mr Cridland, all of whom had been deeply involved with Comstrad and Interdata, that he deliberately entrusted the compliance aspects of his business. Had he made minimal enquiries, or even asked for a copy of my judgment in \u000a

It may be difficult to draw the line in particular cases, but in my opinion the concept of 'management' for present purposes, comprehends activities which involve policy and decision making, related to the business affairs of a corporation, affecting the corporation as a whole or a substantial part of that corporation, to the extent that the consequences of the formation of those policies or the making of those decisions may have some significant bearing on the financial standing of the corporation or the conduct of its affairs.

aV There is a separate question as to the extent to which the company should be held responsible for the breach of section 11. Although I accept that Mr Smith did not himself know of Mr Reichelt's bankrupt status, or of its consequences under section 11, he was aware of Comstrad's dubious activities and the fact that it had been closed down pursuant to Court action. Indeed, he believed that they had pinched some of his own publicity material. Yet it was to Mr Wade, Mr Reichelt and Mr Cridland, all of whom had been deeply involved with Comstrad and Interdata, that he deliberately entrusted the compliance aspects of his business. Had he made minimal enquiries, or even asked for a copy of my judgment in \u000a

aV I will deal with these two issues together because they are linked and they can be dealt with shortly. The company's duty under section 221 of the Companies Act 1985 was to keep accounting records sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions, and such as to disclose with a reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the company at that time. The precise state of the company's affairs is impossible to ascertain from the documents before me. There are various different sets of accounts at different dates, but Mr Ashe, for the company, does not claim that any of them represent a complete or reliable statement of the company's affairs.\u000a
p74
aVThere must be an element of decision making, which affects the corporate enterprise as a whole, but those responsible need not form part of the board, nor even need they be executives directly communicating with the board. Nevertheless, in the ordinary course of affairs, it is only in a large company that a person outside this latter category, so far removed from the power of control exercised by the directors, may be engaged in the 'management' of a company. In a small company like the present the actions of those directly answerable to the directors may amount to 'management', for, even if those people are also engaged in routine activities of the kind not normally associated with management, it is sufficient if powers and functions are delegated to those persons which are likely in their performance to have a significant effect on the business and financial standing of the company. As it is a protective section, protective at least to the creditors and shareholders, it must have been designed to prevent the participation in management of those who might put the solvency or the probity of the corporation's administration at risk.

aV Mr Ashe, for the company, submitted that the System is simply a matter of calculation based on historical data and the updates put in by the customer. He described it as a sophisticated and technologically based 'calculator'. This submission would have some substance if all the programme purported to do was to provide a convenient means of extracting and analysing data as to historical movements in the market, without offering any interpretation of that information as a guide to future action. But such a limited function would be quite inconsistent with the sense of the brochure and the evidence of Mr Day. The whole purpose of the programme, as explained by Mr Day, is to reproduce in computer programme form the concepts developed by legendary market forecasters relating to the use of parabolas in determining the future direction of market price. The part of the brochure dealing with the guarantee describes the System as a medium to long term investment strategy. To qualify for the guarantee the user has to show that he has followed the signals provided by the programme during the 12 month period. That requirement can only make sense if the signals are intended to guide the strategy. \u000a

aV In 1997 Folio No 1846 (the second action) between Royal Reinsurance Company Limited (Royal) and six other plaintiffs and Central Insurance Company Limited (Central), as defendant, Central applies pursuant to Order 12, rule 8 for an order that the order of Mance J dated 4 September 1997 (which granted leave to serve out) be set aside on the grounds that the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant is not governed by English law; England is not the appropriate forum; England is not clearly and distinctly the most appropriate forum; and the case was and is not in all the circumstances a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction.\u000a

aV The plaintiffs obtained leave to serve out of this jurisdiction ex parte on 4 September 1997 in both actions. In the Points of Claim in both actions the plaintiffs claim (1) a declaration that the defendant is in breach of a Claims C-operation Clause, that compliance by the defendant with the requirements of such clause is a condition precedent to the plaintiffs' liability to the defendant under the contract of reinsurance, and that the plaintiffs, by reason of the defendant's breach of the said clause, are not liable to the defendant in respect of the said loss; (2) alternatively a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to avoid and/or rescind the contract of facultative reinsurance with the defendant ab initio for material misrepresentation, and that the contract has been so avoided and/or rescinded.\u000a
p84
aV  (iii) Applications under Order 11, rule 1(1) for leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction are to be determined according to the same principles applicable to a stay of English proceedings subject, however, to the burden being on the plaintiff to show that leave should be granted, and to the court being required to consider both the residence or place of business of the defendant and the relevant ground invoked by the plaintiff when deciding whether to exercise the discretion to grant leave. Accordingly the plaintiff is required to show not merely that England is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, but that it is clearly the appropriate forum. In discharging the burden lying on him, however, the plaintiff is not confined to showing that justice cannot be obtained in an alternative forum, or, if so, only at excessive cost, delay or inconvenience, but is entitled to rely on the nature of the dispute, the legal and practical issues involved and such questions as local knowledge, availability of witnesses and their evidence and expense.\u000a

p89
aV (4) The performance which is characteristic of a reinsurance contract is the provision of insurance cover by the reinsurer (see page 20 Giuliano-Lagarde report, and Plender, The European Contracts Convention (1991) pp 110-111). The central administration of the plaintiffs in the first action and of four of the plaintiffs in the second action is in England (there is an issue as to whether General Accident's central administration is in England or Scotland). The presumption in relation to those plaintiffs is that English law applies to this reinsurance and there are no factors to rebut the presumption. English law applies to the placements with the other two or three plaintiffs.\u000a
p90
aV The reinsurance contracts, the subject matter of both actions, were placed in London on the London market. The terms of the slips and the Claims Co-Operation Clauses demonstrate an implied choice of English law demonstrated with reasonably certainty by the terms of the contract/the circumstances of the case. I refer in particular to the following provisions: first action: Slip Policy NMA 1779, Full Reinsurance Clause NMA 416, Claims Co-Operation Clause 'NMA 464, NMA 1685 and the Claims Co-Operation Clause itself; second action: NMA 1779 Slip Policy, the printed terms at the foot of the first page of the Slip, the full Reinsurance clause, NMA 464 War and Civil War Exclusion Clause, LSW 1001.Several Liability Clause, the references to Lloyds/ILU/Lirma placing support system, and the terms of the Claims Co-Operation Clause itself. \u000a
p91
aV If, contrary to the above I am wrong as to implied choice of English law, the reinsurance contracts the subject matter of both actions are governed by the law of the country with which they are most closely connected, ie England. It is to be presumed that the reinsurance contracts are most closely connected with England where the principal places of business of both plaintiffs in the first action and the principal places of business of four or five out of seven plaintiffs in the second action are situated: see Article 4(2). It does not appear from the circumstances as a whole that the reinsurance contracts are more closely connected with Taiwan (Article 4(5)). In the case of all plaintiffs, the reinsurance contracts are governed by the law of the country (England) with which they are most closely connected. The reasoning under heading 1 above (Implied choice of English law) is repeated so far as applicable.\u000a
p92
aV Central, as the reinsured with a monetary claim against the plaintiffs, are the natural plaintiffs. The nature of the action, being one solely for negative declarations by natural defendants, must be viewed with great caution in all situations involving possible conflicts of jurisdiction since they obviously lend themselves to improper attempts at forum shopping: \u000a

aV (supra) at 371. The action was commenced with indecent haste. It was launched before the plaintiffs had given notice of any avoidance, which came only in the form of paragraph 14 of the Points of Claim. It was not preceded by any letter before action. The plaintiffs have indulged in improper forum shopping in a case where they perceive advantage in any ultimate trial in having the issues pending in home territory.\u000a
p94
aV I refer to the letters referred to in the chronology in the first action, AF 3 (but not the comments column), and to Tai Ping's letter of 27 August 1997. I also refer to the letters referred to in the chronology in the second action, AF 2 (but again not to the comments column). The correspondence following the letters of 28 April and 20 March 1997 quoted above reflects apparent failures to respond to the points raised in those letters. In my opinion the plaintiffs have established a good arguable case that there is good reason for seeking the relief, that the relief is useful, that a solid practical benefit will ensue, and that the declarations are sought for a valid and valuable purpose.\u000a
p95

aV As to issue (1), the documents will provide essential evidence. I refer again to the documents listed to in the chronologies. The plaintiffs at all times dealt with the defendants' London brokers. I note the way the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants are pleaded in the Points of Claim in the two actions and by way of example only refer to the reference to investigations .... relevant to the issue of Tai Ping's/Central's liability to Winbond. This may be sensitive to some factual evidence from Taiwan (and evidence as to the law of Taiwan). As to the law of Taiwan, the affidavit evidence before me suggests that it should be possible to agree this. I consider that discovery will probably narrow any need for factual evidence. To the extent that factual evidence is required, I have already referred to Mr Robbins of Burgoynes and to Mr Purdon of GAB Robins. If any further factual evidence is required from Taiwan it is in my view likely to be within relatively narrow limits. \u000a

Tai Ping can join its Taiwanese brokers as a third party to this action if it wishes to pursue a claim against those brokers: Order 11, rule 1(1)(c) and Order 16. As the London and Taiwanese brokers are now part of the Aon International Group, no prejudice will flow from that claim being dealt with in this country. In relation to a third party claim, evidence from witnesses in Taiwan becomes potentially relevant. However, all the potential witnesses appear to be able to correspond in English. The extent to which any issues of fact in the third party proceedings will be contentious is not something which has been explored in detail before me.\u000a

aV In 1997 Folio No 1845 (the first action) between Gan Insurance Company Limited (GAN) and Eagle Star Insurance Company Limited (Eagle Star), as first and second plaintiffs, and The Tai Ping Insurance Company Limited (Tai Ping), as defendant, Tai Ping applies pursuant to Order 12, rule 8(1) to discharge the order of Mance J of 4 September 1997 (which granted leave to serve out) and to set aside service of the writ on the grounds that the court has no jurisdiction in respect of the plaintiffs' claims and/or that this was not a proper case for the grant of leave to serve the proceedings out of the jurisdiction.\u000a
p134
aV In 1997 Folio No 1846 (the second action) between Royal Reinsurance Company Limited (Royal) and six other plaintiffs and Central Insurance Company Limited (Central), as defendant, Central applies pursuant to Order 12, rule 8 for an order that the order of Mance J dated 4 September 1997 (which granted leave to serve out) be set aside on the grounds that the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant is not governed by English law; England is not the appropriate forum; England is not clearly and distinctly the most appropriate forum; and the case was and is not in all the circumstances a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction.\u000a
p135
aV (4) The performance which is characteristic of a reinsurance contract is the provision of insurance cover by the reinsurer (see page 20 Giuliano-Lagarde report, and Plender, The European Contracts Convention (1991) pp 110-111). The central administration of the plaintiffs in the first action and of four of the plaintiffs in the second action is in England (there is an issue as to whether General Accident's central administration is in England or Scotland). The presumption in relation to those plaintiffs is that English law applies to this reinsurance and there are no factors to rebut the presumption. English law applies to the placements with the other two or three plaintiffs.\u000a
p136
aV The reinsurance contracts, the subject matter of both actions, were placed in London on the London market. The terms of the slips and the Claims Co-Operation Clauses demonstrate an implied choice of English law demonstrated with reasonably certainty by the terms of the contract/the circumstances of the case. I refer in particular to the following provisions: first action: Slip Policy NMA 1779, Full Reinsurance Clause NMA 416, Claims Co-Operation Clause 'NMA 464, NMA 1685 and the Claims Co-Operation Clause itself; second action: NMA 1779 Slip Policy, the printed terms at the foot of the first page of the Slip, the full Reinsurance clause, NMA 464 War and Civil War Exclusion Clause, LSW 1001.Several Liability Clause, the references to Lloyds/ILU/Lirma placing support system, and the terms of the Claims Co-Operation Clause itself. \u000a
p137
aV If, contrary to the above I am wrong as to implied choice of English law, the reinsurance contracts the subject matter of both actions are governed by the law of the country with which they are most closely connected, ie England. It is to be presumed that the reinsurance contracts are most closely connected with England where the principal places of business of both plaintiffs in the first action and the principal places of business of four or five out of seven plaintiffs in the second action are situated: see Article 4(2). It does not appear from the circumstances as a whole that the reinsurance contracts are more closely connected with Taiwan (Article 4(5)). In the case of all plaintiffs, the reinsurance contracts are governed by the law of the country (England) with which they are most closely connected. The reasoning under heading 1 above (Implied choice of English law) is repeated so far as applicable.\u000a
p138
aV I refer to the letters referred to in the chronology in the first action, AF 3 (but not the comments column), and to Tai Ping's letter of 27 August 1997. I also refer to the letters referred to in the chronology in the second action, AF 2 (but again not to the comments column). The correspondence following the letters of 28 April and 20 March 1997 quoted above reflects apparent failures to respond to the points raised in those letters. In my opinion the plaintiffs have established a good arguable case that there is good reason for seeking the relief, that the relief is useful, that a solid practical benefit will ensue, and that the declarations are sought for a valid and valuable purpose.\u000a
p139
aV Tai Ping state they wish to claim against the Taiwanese brokers. Tai Ping can join its Taiwanese brokers as a third party to this action if it wishes to pursue a claim against those brokers: Order 11, rule 1(1)(c) and Order 16. As the London and Taiwanese brokers are now part of the Aon International Group, no prejudice will flow from that claim being dealt with in this country. In relation to a third party claim, evidence from witnesses in Taiwan becomes potentially relevant. However, all the potential witnesses appear to be able to correspond in English. The extent to which any issues of fact in the third party proceedings will be contentious is not something which has been explored in detail before me.\u000a
p140
aV The plaintiffs obtained leave to serve out of this jurisdiction ex parte on 4 September 1997 in both actions. In the Points of Claim in both actions the plaintiffs claim (1) a declaration that the defendant is in breach of a Claims C-operation Clause, that compliance by the defendant with the requirements of such clause is a condition precedent to the plaintiffs' liability to the defendant under the contract of reinsurance, and that the plaintiffs, by reason of the defendant's breach of the said clause, are not liable to the defendant in respect of the said loss; (2) alternatively a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to avoid and/or rescind the contract of facultative reinsurance with the defendant ab initio for material misrepresentation, and that the contract has been so avoided and/or rescinded.\u000a

aV Central, as the reinsured with a monetary claim against the plaintiffs, are the natural plaintiffs. The nature of the action, being one solely for negative declarations by natural defendants, must be viewed with great caution in all situations involving possible conflicts of jurisdiction since they obviously lend themselves to improper attempts at forum shopping: \u000a

p144
aV As to issue (1), the documents will provide essential evidence. I refer again to the documents listed to in the chronologies. The plaintiffs at all times dealt with the defendants' London brokers. I note the way the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants are pleaded in the Points of Claim in the two actions and by way of example only refer to the reference to investigations .... relevant to the issue of Tai Ping's/Central's liability to Winbond. This may be sensitive to some factual evidence from Taiwan (and evidence as to the law of Taiwan). As to the law of Taiwan, the affidavit evidence before me suggests that it should be possible to agree this. I consider that discovery will probably narrow any need for factual evidence. To the extent that factual evidence is required, I have already referred to Mr Robbins of Burgoynes and to Mr Purdon of GAB Robins. If any further factual evidence is required from Taiwan it is in my view likely to be within relatively narrow limits. \u000a
p145
aV As to issue (2), in the first action it is not contended by Tai Ping that the plaintiffs' consent was obtained. In the second action this issue will primarily require consideration of the documents.\u000a
p146
aV  (iii) Applications under Order 11, rule 1(1) for leave to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction are to be determined according to the same principles applicable to a stay of English proceedings subject, however, to the burden being on the plaintiff to show that leave should be granted, and to the court being required to consider both the residence or place of business of the defendant and the relevant ground invoked by the plaintiff when deciding whether to exercise the discretion to grant leave. Accordingly the plaintiff is required to show not merely that England is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, but that it is clearly the appropriate forum. In discharging the burden lying on him, however, the plaintiff is not confined to showing that justice cannot be obtained in an alternative forum, or, if so, only at excessive cost, delay or inconvenience, but is entitled to rely on the nature of the dispute, the legal and practical issues involved and such questions as local knowledge, availability of witnesses and their evidence and expense.\u000a

aV Central, who are a Taiwanese insurance company, participated as one of five insurers in an EAR policy reinsuring Winbond Electronics Corporation (Winbond) in respect of the erection of a hi-tech semi-conductor wafer fabrication plant in Taiwan known as FAB-III. Tai Ping were the lead insurers. Tai Ping obtained facultative reinsurance of their line from among others GAN and Eagle Star. Central obtained facultative reinsurance of their line from eight reinsurers on the slip, seven of whom are plaintiffs in the second action. Of these the third, GAN, and the sixth, Eagle Star, are also reinsurers of the leaders Tai Ping (and plaintiffs in the first action).\u000a

It is to be presumed that the reinsurance contracts are most closely connected with England where the principal places of business of both plaintiffs in the first action and the principal places of business of four or five out of seven plaintiffs in the second action are situated: see Article 4(2). It does not appear from the circumstances as a whole that the reinsurance contracts are more closely connected with Taiwan (Article 4(5)). In the case of all plaintiffs, the reinsurance contracts are governed by the law of the country (England) with which they are most closely connected. The reasoning under heading 1 above (Implied choice of English law) is repeated so far as applicable.\u000a

aV The plaintiffs obtained leave to serve out of this jurisdiction ex parte on 4 September 1997 in both actions. In the Points of Claim in both actions the plaintiffs claim (1) a declaration that the defendant is in breach of a Claims C-operation Clause, that compliance by the defendant with the requirements of such clause is a condition precedent to the plaintiffs' liability to the defendant under the contract of reinsurance, and that the plaintiffs, by reason of the defendant's breach of the said clause, are not liable to the defendant in respect of the said loss; (2) alternatively a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to avoid and/or rescind the contract of facultative reinsurance with the defendant ab initio for material misrepresentation, and that the contract has been so avoided and/or rescinded.\u000a

aV As to issue (1), the documents will provide essential evidence. I refer again to the documents listed to in the chronologies. The plaintiffs at all times dealt with the defendants' London brokers. I note the way the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants are pleaded in the Points of Claim in the two actions and by way of example only refer to the reference to investigations .... relevant to the issue of Tai Ping's/Central's liability to Winbond. This may be sensitive to some factual evidence from Taiwan (and evidence as to the law of Taiwan). As to the law of Taiwan, the affidavit evidence before me suggests that it should be possible to agree this. I consider that discovery will probably narrow any need for factual evidence. To the extent that factual evidence is required, I have already referred to Mr Robbins of Burgoynes and to Mr Purdon of GAB Robins. If any further factual evidence is required from Taiwan it is in my view likely to be within relatively narrow limits. \u000a

It was launched before the plaintiffs had given notice of any avoidance, which came only in the form of paragraph 14 of the Points of Claim. It was not preceded by any letter before action.

The correspondence following the letters of 28 April and 20 March 1997 quoted above reflects apparent failures to respond to the points raised in those letters. In my opinion the plaintiffs have established a good arguable case that there is good reason for seeking the relief, that the relief is useful, that a solid practical benefit will ensue, and that the declarations are sought for a valid and valuable purpose.\u000a

aV 1. Underwriters will not exercise their right to avoid this Policy where it is alleged that there has been non-disclosure or misrepresentation of facts or untrue statements in the proposal form, provided always that THE ASSURED shall establish to Underwriters' satisfaction that such alleged non-disclosure, misrepresentation or untrue statement, was free of any fraudulent intent.\u000a
p239
aV If, however, an authorised person is subject to the rules of an SRO, then in the first place it is for that SRO to enforce its rules, and the SIB is only permitted to take action under section 61 if it appears to the SIB that that SRO is unable or unwilling to take appropriate steps itself to enforce compliance: see sections 61(1)(a)(iv) and 61(2).\u000a
p240
aV The power of an SRO to enforce its rules in contract or of the SIB to enforce its own rules by virtue of section 61 does not prevent an investor himself exercising any rights or remedies to which he may be personally entitled (see section 61(9)). Those rights or remedies may lie at common law, but in addition (private) investors who have suffered loss as a result of a contravention of an SRO's or the SIB's rules are given a right of action for damages for breach of statutory duty: see sections 62 and 62A.\u000a
p241
aVThe reason why transfers could be promptly listed on the attached schedule, but opt-outs could not be, was that transfers could be easily recalled from the JRA computerised data-base, but opt-outs could only be identified by visiting each pension transaction separately.\u000a

aV To an outsider reading merely what the Lautro letter had to say about the proposed SIB review, it may not appear clear that what SIB had in mind was that the recommendations to be generated were for a review by the industry as a whole into the relevant transactions. I have no doubt, however, that the TSW letter put the matter accurately when it glossed the review proposals as follows:\u000a
p243
aV When the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was sent, within a few days of the end of the period of the then current year's policies, JRA had already completed a new proposal form for the following year's PII cover. This was effected through different brokers, as there had been dissatisfaction with JRA's previous brokers leading to a change. The new proposal was in fact dated 21 January 1994, six days before the TSW letter. At the end of the proposal JRA added two items of Additional Information ... that we believe to be material to this application, the first of which was:\u000a
p244
aV I infer that the TSW letter had been under discussion for a little time, even though in the event it was delayed for a few days more. On behalf of the underwriters, Mr Kealey speculated that the notification to underwriters was itself a reaction to the following year insurers' unhappiness at undertaking responsibility for past pension mis-selling. Indeed Mr Kealey was prepared to infer that with new brokers in the saddle the new insurers were saying - Not in our policy! He submitted, however, that the nature of any such discussions or negotiations was irrelevant to the issues before me, even if the prospective new insurers were threatening to exclude past pension mis-selling or to weight the premium.\u000a
p245
aV On 28 February 1994 SIB issued an interim progress report on the steps it was taking to implement its review. After referring to the development of recommendations regarding safeguards for future business, the interim report turned to Remedial action and outlined a timetable for SROs to issue guidance to their members on which categories of pension transfer cases they must actively reconsider as a matter of priority and as to what members would be expected to do by way of providing remedies for past inadequate advice.\u000a
p246
aV I would like to obtain your agreement to my proposal, which although made without any admission of liability, will then legally commit me to an agreed course of action ...\u000a
p247
aV In return for my commitment to this course of action, I will ask you to agree that the offer of redress made in this letter is made without admission of liability and that any redress given under this letter, when carried out, will be in full and final settlement of any claim that you may have against myself arising out of the advice given in respect of the above Plan.\u000a
p248
aV On behalf of underwriters Mr Kealey submitted that the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was invalid as a purported notice under General Condition 2 (GC2). He emphasised that the term, where it applied, afforded to the assured a valuable benefit in extending into the future the right to be indemnified by claims made subsequent to the original period of insurance but arising out of the notified circumstances. It followed, he argued, that the benefit should not be abused by an assured's attempt to seek spurious protection for the future where present circumstances did not justify the giving of a notice. The words any circumstance of which THE ASSURED shall become aware required some new knowledge on the part of JRA. The words which may give rise to a claim laid down an objective test, which required that there must be a real, or material, risk, something more than a de minimis risk, something more than a negligible, fanciful or speculative risk, that the circumstance notified may lead to a claim. Neither the KPMG report nor Lautro's letter in reaction to it justified the view that JRA had become aware of anything new which could objectively and reasonably be said to amount to such a risk. All that had been identified was a possible problem. The statistical risk that each year's pension selling might ultimately give rise to claims was nothing new, and the KPMG report was merely further statistics. In any event, it did not apply to JRA. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA to suggest that their appointed representatives were mis-selling pensions. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA that their procedures for vetting opt-outs and transfers were not working. The fact that competitors carrying on business in the same market might be susceptible to criticism in certain cases in which they, but not JRA, had been involved was irrelevant.\u000a
p249
aVMoreover, JRA were not moved to give notice by prior warnings, such as Lautro's Enforcement Bulletin 14, which spoke of the potential problem, or EB16, which spoke to the size of the overall problem. It was probable, therefore, that the notice of 27 January 1994, coming as it did more than a month after Lautro's letter of 22 December 1993, but only a few days before the end of the current period of insurance and only a few days after the completion of a proposal form for the next year's cover, was a tactical reaction to difficulties experienced in obtaining the next year's cover rather than a genuine reaction to the KPMG report and Lautro's letter. In this connection, it was significant that there had been no witness from JRA to speak to the origins of the TSW letter.\u000a
p250
aV Mr Symons has two answers to this. First, on the facts he submits that EB16 was different from the KPMG report and the reactions then engendered: it was primarily concerned with providing guidance for future sales. In as much as it called for a special monitoring exercise as respects existing investors, that exercise was limited to PPPs which during the third quarter of 1992 had been terminated or made paid up by investors within two years of purchase. JRA's own exercise merely showed that there were no such PPPs in their own as then short history. Secondly, as a matter of construction he submits that the last line of Exclusion 2 (or which were known to THE ASSURED prior to the inception of this Policy) and the Special Conditions are inconsistent with one another, in that the latter purport to cover, albeit limited to the amount and extent of the previous year's insurance, what the former seeks to exclude - with the result that the exclusion must make way for the express inclusion.\u000a
p251
aV There are it seems to me two possible approaches to this problem. There is the approach reflected in Mr Symons' submission that, in the case of inconsistency, the exclusion must make way for the inclusion. There is, however, the alternative approach of asking whether the exclusion can be given some more limited scope, so as not to be in head-long inconsistency with Special Condition 2. The latter approach is to my mind more satisfactory, if it is open. In this connection I am inclined to think that Exclusion 2 is intended to apply in circumstances where there is fraudulent intent, or strictly speaking where the assured has been unable to establish to underwriter's satisfaction that a non-disclosure, misrepresentation or untrue statement was free of any fraudulent intent, but where underwriters do not wish to avoid the whole policy. Nevertheless, they wish to be free to refuse to indemnify the assured in the case of claims arising out of the non-disclosure of circumstances known to the assured prior to inception and which have led to claims being made during the period of the policy. So limited, the last line of Exclusion 2 makes sense. It is part of the non-disclosure code of the policy. If there is a waiver of such non-disclosure, the exclusion does not operate. But if there is no fraudulent intent, the Special Conditions prevail, which is to say that not only is there no right of avoidance (Special Condition 1), but there is a guarantee of cover limited to the cover of a preceding insurance (Special Condition 2). It follows that, if there was no cover in the previous year, Special Condition 2 cannot apply, for then neither hypothesis (2) within it nor the limitation to the previous year's cover, can operate. In the present case, however, there was insurance in the preceding year.\u000a

p253
aV Clearly the expression claim made is broader than suit brought since a claim can be made in any of a number of ways without the institution of an action. My brother Goodman accepts that this is so but answers that, where an action has been commenced by the issue of a writ, the consequence in law of the writ's issue is that the claim must be taken as having been made at that time, on the common law principle that the defendant must be deemed to have notice of it at that time.\u000a
p254
aV I think that the primary meaning of the word claim - whether used in a popular sense or in a strict legal sense - is such as to attach itself to the object that is claimed; it is not the same thing as a cause of action by which the claim may be supported or as the grounds on which it may be based. In the Oxford Dictionary claim is defined as, first, A demand for something as due; an assertion of a right to something ...\u000a
p255
aV Sample 2 is perhaps worth mentioning separately in this context. As I understand the matter the claim in respect of sample 2 is made by JRA, but JRA are not responsible for it, and have not offered redress to Mrs Harwood in respect of it. That has been done by Mr Cameron, to whom JRA are merely minded to lend the money to enable compensation to be made. If Mr Cameron were a plaintiff in this action, then the claim would be his, and plainly his excess and not JRA's would be relevant.\u000a
p256
aV On behalf of underwriters Mr Kealey submitted that the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was invalid as a purported notice under General Condition 2 (GC2). He emphasised that the term, where it applied, afforded to the assured a valuable benefit in extending into the future the right to be indemnified by claims made subsequent to the original period of insurance but arising out of the notified circumstances. It followed, he argued, that the benefit should not be abused by an assured's attempt to seek spurious protection for the future where present circumstances did not justify the giving of a notice. The words any circumstance of which THE ASSURED shall become aware required some new knowledge on the part of JRA. The words which may give rise to a claim laid down an objective test, which required that there must be a real, or material, risk, something more than a de minimis risk, something more than a negligible, fanciful or speculative risk, that the circumstance notified may lead to a claim. Neither the KPMG report nor Lautro's letter in reaction to it justified the view that JRA had become aware of anything new which could objectively and reasonably be said to amount to such a risk. All that had been identified was a possible problem. The statistical risk that each year's pension selling might ultimately give rise to claims was nothing new, and the KPMG report was merely further statistics. In any event, it did not apply to JRA. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA to suggest that their appointed representatives were mis-selling pensions. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA that their procedures for vetting opt-outs and transfers were not working. The fact that competitors carrying on business in the same market might be susceptible to criticism in certain cases in which they, but not JRA, had been involved was irrelevant.\u000a

aV If, however, an authorised person is subject to the rules of an SRO, then in the first place it is for that SRO to enforce its rules, and the SIB is only permitted to take action under section 61 if it appears to the SIB that that SRO is unable or unwilling to take appropriate steps itself to enforce compliance: see sections 61(1)(a)(iv) and 61(2).\u000a
p259
aV The power of an SRO to enforce its rules in contract or of the SIB to enforce its own rules by virtue of section 61 does not prevent an investor himself exercising any rights or remedies to which he may be personally entitled (see section 61(9)). Those rights or remedies may lie at common law, but in addition (private) investors who have suffered loss as a result of a contravention of an SRO's or the SIB's rules are given a right of action for damages for breach of statutory duty: see sections 62 and 62A.\u000a

aV I infer that the TSW letter had been under discussion for a little time, even though in the event it was delayed for a few days more. On behalf of the underwriters, Mr Kealey speculated that the notification to underwriters was itself a reaction to the following year insurers' unhappiness at undertaking responsibility for past pension mis-selling. Indeed Mr Kealey was prepared to infer that with new brokers in the saddle the new insurers were saying - Not in our policy! He submitted, however, that the nature of any such discussions or negotiations was irrelevant to the issues before me, even if the prospective new insurers were threatening to exclude past pension mis-selling or to weight the premium.\u000a

p262
aVMoreover, JRA were not moved to give notice by prior warnings, such as Lautro's Enforcement Bulletin 14, which spoke of the potential problem, or EB16, which spoke to the size of the overall problem. It was probable, therefore, that the notice of 27 January 1994, coming as it did more than a month after Lautro's letter of 22 December 1993, but only a few days before the end of the current period of insurance and only a few days after the completion of a proposal form for the next year's cover, was a tactical reaction to difficulties experienced in obtaining the next year's cover rather than a genuine reaction to the KPMG report and Lautro's letter. In this connection, it was significant that there had been no witness from JRA to speak to the origins of the TSW letter.\u000a

This was effected through different brokers, as there had been dissatisfaction with JRA's previous brokers leading to a change. The new proposal was in fact dated 21 January 1994, six days before the TSW letter.

After referring to the development of recommendations regarding safeguards for future business, the interim report turned to Remedial action and outlined a timetable for SROs to issue guidance to their members on which categories of pension transfer cases they must actively reconsider as a matter of priority and as to what members would be expected to do by way of providing remedies for past inadequate advice.\u000a

aV Clearly the expression claim made is broader than suit brought since a claim can be made in any of a number of ways without the institution of an action. My brother Goodman accepts that this is so but answers that, where an action has been commenced by the issue of a writ, the consequence in law of the writ's issue is that the claim must be taken as having been made at that time, on the common law principle that the defendant must be deemed to have notice of it at that time.\u000a

aV I infer that the TSW letter had been under discussion for a little time, even though in the event it was delayed for a few days more. On behalf of the underwriters, Mr Kealey speculated that the notification to underwriters was itself a reaction to the following year insurers' unhappiness at undertaking responsibility for past pension mis-selling. Indeed Mr Kealey was prepared to infer that with new brokers in the saddle the new insurers were saying - Not in our policy! He submitted, however, that the nature of any such discussions or negotiations was irrelevant to the issues before me, even if the prospective new insurers were threatening to exclude past pension mis-selling or to weight the premium.\u000a
p296
aV On behalf of underwriters Mr Kealey submitted that the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was invalid as a purported notice under General Condition 2 (GC2). He emphasised that the term, where it applied, afforded to the assured a valuable benefit in extending into the future the right to be indemnified by claims made subsequent to the original period of insurance but arising out of the notified circumstances. It followed, he argued, that the benefit should not be abused by an assured's attempt to seek spurious protection for the future where present circumstances did not justify the giving of a notice. The words any circumstance of which THE ASSURED shall become aware required some new knowledge on the part of JRA. The words which may give rise to a claim laid down an objective test, which required that there must be a real, or material, risk, something more than a de minimis risk, something more than a negligible, fanciful or speculative risk, that the circumstance notified may lead to a claim. Neither the KPMG report nor Lautro's letter in reaction to it justified the view that JRA had become aware of anything new which could objectively and reasonably be said to amount to such a risk. All that had been identified was a possible problem. The statistical risk that each year's pension selling might ultimately give rise to claims was nothing new, and the KPMG report was merely further statistics. In any event, it did not apply to JRA. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA to suggest that their appointed representatives were mis-selling pensions. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA that their procedures for vetting opt-outs and transfers were not working. The fact that competitors carrying on business in the same market might be susceptible to criticism in certain cases in which they, but not JRA, had been involved was irrelevant.\u000a
p297
aVMoreover, JRA were not moved to give notice by prior warnings, such as Lautro's Enforcement Bulletin 14, which spoke of the potential problem, or EB16, which spoke to the size of the overall problem. It was probable, therefore, that the notice of 27 January 1994, coming as it did more than a month after Lautro's letter of 22 December 1993, but only a few days before the end of the current period of insurance and only a few days after the completion of a proposal form for the next year's cover, was a tactical reaction to difficulties experienced in obtaining the next year's cover rather than a genuine reaction to the KPMG report and Lautro's letter. In this connection, it was significant that there had been no witness from JRA to speak to the origins of the TSW letter.\u000a
p298
aV Mr Symons has two answers to this. First, on the facts he submits that EB16 was different from the KPMG report and the reactions then engendered: it was primarily concerned with providing guidance for future sales. In as much as it called for a special monitoring exercise as respects existing investors, that exercise was limited to PPPs which during the third quarter of 1992 had been terminated or made paid up by investors within two years of purchase. JRA's own exercise merely showed that there were no such PPPs in their own as then short history. Secondly, as a matter of construction he submits that the last line of Exclusion 2 (or which were known to THE ASSURED prior to the inception of this Policy) and the Special Conditions are inconsistent with one another, in that the latter purport to cover, albeit limited to the amount and extent of the previous year's insurance, what the former seeks to exclude - with the result that the exclusion must make way for the express inclusion.\u000a

aV There are it seems to me two possible approaches to this problem. There is the approach reflected in Mr Symons' submission that, in the case of inconsistency, the exclusion must make way for the inclusion. There is, however, the alternative approach of asking whether the exclusion can be given some more limited scope, so as not to be in head-long inconsistency with Special Condition 2. The latter approach is to my mind more satisfactory, if it is open. In this connection I am inclined to think that Exclusion 2 is intended to apply in circumstances where there is fraudulent intent, or strictly speaking where the assured has been unable to establish to underwriter's satisfaction that a non-disclosure, misrepresentation or untrue statement was free of any fraudulent intent, but where underwriters do not wish to avoid the whole policy. Nevertheless, they wish to be free to refuse to indemnify the assured in the case of claims arising out of the non-disclosure of circumstances known to the assured prior to inception and which have led to claims being made during the period of the policy. So limited, the last line of Exclusion 2 makes sense. It is part of the non-disclosure code of the policy. If there is a waiver of such non-disclosure, the exclusion does not operate. But if there is no fraudulent intent, the Special Conditions prevail, which is to say that not only is there no right of avoidance (Special Condition 1), but there is a guarantee of cover limited to the cover of a preceding insurance (Special Condition 2). It follows that, if there was no cover in the previous year, Special Condition 2 cannot apply, for then neither hypothesis (2) within it nor the limitation to the previous year's cover, can operate. In the present case, however, there was insurance in the preceding year.\u000a

aV To an outsider reading merely what the Lautro letter had to say about the proposed SIB review, it may not appear clear that what SIB had in mind was that the recommendations to be generated were for a review by the industry as a whole into the relevant transactions. I have no doubt, however, that the TSW letter put the matter accurately when it glossed the review proposals as follows:\u000a
p311
aV When the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was sent, within a few days of the end of the period of the then current year's policies, JRA had already completed a new proposal form for the following year's PII cover. This was effected through different brokers, as there had been dissatisfaction with JRA's previous brokers leading to a change. The new proposal was in fact dated 21 January 1994, six days before the TSW letter. At the end of the proposal JRA added two items of Additional Information ... that we believe to be material to this application, the first of which was:\u000a

aV On 28 February 1994 SIB issued an interim progress report on the steps it was taking to implement its review. After referring to the development of recommendations regarding safeguards for future business, the interim report turned to Remedial action and outlined a timetable for SROs to issue guidance to their members on which categories of pension transfer cases they must actively reconsider as a matter of priority and as to what members would be expected to do by way of providing remedies for past inadequate advice.\u000a

That has been done by Mr Cameron, to whom JRA are merely minded to lend the money to enable compensation to be made. If Mr Cameron were a plaintiff in this action, then the claim would be his, and plainly his excess and not JRA's would be relevant.\u000a

There is, however, the alternative approach of asking whether the exclusion can be given some more limited scope, so as not to be in head-long inconsistency with Special Condition 2. The latter approach is to my mind more satisfactory, if it is open. In this connection I am inclined to think that Exclusion 2 is intended to apply in circumstances where there is fraudulent intent, or strictly speaking where the assured has been unable to establish to underwriter's satisfaction that a non-disclosure, misrepresentation or untrue statement was free of any fraudulent intent, but where underwriters do not wish to avoid the whole policy. Nevertheless, they wish to be free to refuse to indemnify the assured in the case of claims arising out of the non-disclosure of circumstances known to the assured prior to inception and which have led to claims being made during the period of the policy. So limited, the last line of Exclusion 2 makes sense. It is part of the non-disclosure code of the policy. If there is a waiver of such non-disclosure, the exclusion does not operate. But if there is no fraudulent intent, the Special Conditions prevail, which is to say that not only is there no right of avoidance (Special Condition 1), but there is a guarantee of cover limited to the cover of a preceding insurance (Special Condition 2). It follows that, if there was no cover in the previous year, Special Condition 2 cannot apply, for then neither hypothesis (2) within it nor the limitation to the previous year's cover, can operate. In the present case, however, there was insurance in the preceding year.\u000a

He emphasised that the term, where it applied, afforded to the assured a valuable benefit in extending into the future the right to be indemnified by claims made subsequent to the original period of insurance but arising out of the notified circumstances. It followed, he argued, that the benefit should not be abused by an assured's attempt to seek spurious protection for the future where present circumstances did not justify the giving of a notice. The words any circumstance of which THE ASSURED shall become aware required some new knowledge on the part of JRA. The words which may give rise to a claim laid down an objective test, which required that there must be a real, or material, risk, something more than a de minimis risk, something more than a negligible, fanciful or speculative risk, that the circumstance notified may lead to a claim. Neither the KPMG report nor Lautro's letter in reaction to it justified the view that JRA had become aware of anything new which could objectively and reasonably be said to amount to such a risk. All that had been identified was a possible problem. The statistical risk that each year's pension selling might ultimately give rise to claims was nothing new, and the KPMG report was merely further statistics. In any event, it did not apply to JRA. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA to suggest that their appointed representatives were mis-selling pensions. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA that their procedures for vetting opt-outs and transfers were not working. The fact that competitors carrying on business in the same market might be susceptible to criticism in certain cases in which they, but not JRA, had been involved was irrelevant.\u000a

aV I infer that the TSW letter had been under discussion for a little time, even though in the event it was delayed for a few days more. On behalf of the underwriters, Mr Kealey speculated that the notification to underwriters was itself a reaction to the following year insurers' unhappiness at undertaking responsibility for past pension mis-selling. Indeed Mr Kealey was prepared to infer that with new brokers in the saddle the new insurers were saying - Not in our policy! He submitted, however, that the nature of any such discussions or negotiations was irrelevant to the issues before me, even if the prospective new insurers were threatening to exclude past pension mis-selling or to weight the premium.\u000a

aV On 28 February 1994 SIB issued an interim progress report on the steps it was taking to implement its review. After referring to the development of recommendations regarding safeguards for future business, the interim report turned to Remedial action and outlined a timetable for SROs to issue guidance to their members on which categories of pension transfer cases they must actively reconsider as a matter of priority and as to what members would be expected to do by way of providing remedies for past inadequate advice.\u000a

In this connection, it was significant that there had been no witness from JRA to speak to the origins of the TSW letter.\u000a
p367
aV Mr Symons has two answers to this. First, on the facts he submits that EB16 was different from the KPMG report and the reactions then engendered: it was primarily concerned with providing guidance for future sales. In as much as it called for a special monitoring exercise as respects existing investors, that exercise was limited to PPPs which during the third quarter of 1992 had been terminated or made paid up by investors within two years of purchase. JRA's own exercise merely showed that there were no such PPPs in their own as then short history. Secondly, as a matter of construction he submits that the last line of Exclusion 2 (or which were known to THE ASSURED prior to the inception of this Policy) and the Special Conditions are inconsistent with one another, in that the latter purport to cover, albeit limited to the amount and extent of the previous year's insurance, what the former seeks to exclude - with the result that the exclusion must make way for the express inclusion.\u000a
p368
aV There are it seems to me two possible approaches to this problem. There is the approach reflected in Mr Symons' submission that, in the case of inconsistency, the exclusion must make way for the inclusion. There is, however, the alternative approach of asking whether the exclusion can be given some more limited scope, so as not to be in head-long inconsistency with Special Condition 2. The latter approach is to my mind more satisfactory, if it is open. In this connection I am inclined to think that Exclusion 2 is intended to apply in circumstances where there is fraudulent intent, or strictly speaking where the assured has been unable to establish to underwriter's satisfaction that a non-disclosure, misrepresentation or untrue statement was free of any fraudulent intent, but where underwriters do not wish to avoid the whole policy. Nevertheless, they wish to be free to refuse to indemnify the assured in the case of claims arising out of the non-disclosure of circumstances known to the assured prior to inception and which have led to claims being made during the period of the policy. So limited, the last line of Exclusion 2 makes sense. It is part of the non-disclosure code of the policy. If there is a waiver of such non-disclosure, the exclusion does not operate. But if there is no fraudulent intent, the Special Conditions prevail, which is to say that not only is there no right of avoidance (Special Condition 1), but there is a guarantee of cover limited to the cover of a preceding insurance (Special Condition 2). It follows that, if there was no cover in the previous year, Special Condition 2 cannot apply, for then neither hypothesis (2) within it nor the limitation to the previous year's cover, can operate. In the present case, however, there was insurance in the preceding year.\u000a

aV Mr Kealey points out that whereas a claim might in certain circumstances mean no more than a mere right of action (\u000a

In the Oxford Dictionary claim is defined as, first, A demand for something as due; an assertion of a right to something ...\u000a
p372
aV Sample 2 is perhaps worth mentioning separately in this context. As I understand the matter the claim in respect of sample 2 is made by JRA, but JRA are not responsible for it, and have not offered redress to Mrs Harwood in respect of it. That has been done by Mr Cameron, to whom JRA are merely minded to lend the money to enable compensation to be made. If Mr Cameron were a plaintiff in this action, then the claim would be his, and plainly his excess and not JRA's would be relevant.\u000a

In the Oxford Dictionary claim is defined as, first, A demand for something as due; an assertion of a right to something ...\u000a

aV When the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was sent, within a few days of the end of the period of the then current year's policies, JRA had already completed a new proposal form for the following year's PII cover. This was effected through different brokers, as there had been dissatisfaction with JRA's previous brokers leading to a change. The new proposal was in fact dated 21 January 1994, six days before the TSW letter. At the end of the proposal JRA added two items of Additional Information ... that we believe to be material to this application, the first of which was:\u000a

Further, the conclusion that it is the law of incorporation which should be used to decide questions of title, including questions as to priority of title, does, I believe, lead to certainty as opposed to applying the lex loci actus which can raise doubt as to what is the relevant transaction to be considered and where it takes place. ...

The only possible answer, so far as concerns an immediate transfer of title on sale, is that the trust related to the company's current stock of bullion answering the contractual description; for there was no other bullion to which the trust could relate... The company cannot have intended to create an interest in its general stock of gold which would have inhibited any dealings with it otherwise and for the purpose of delivery under the non-allocated sale contract. Conversely the customer, who is presumed to have intended that somewhere in the bullion held by or on behalf of the company there would be stored a quantity representing his bullion, cannot have contemplated that its rights would be fixed by reference to a combination of the quantity of bullion that the relevant description which the company happened to have in stock at the relevant time and the number of purchasers who happened to have opened contracts at that time for the goods of that description. .. .Nor is the argument improved by reshaping the trust, so as to contemplate that the property in the res vendita did pass to the customer, albeit in the absence of delivery, and then merged in a general equitable title to the pooled stock of bullion.

The customer purchased for the physical delivery on demand of the precise quantity of bullion fixed by his contract, not a shifting proportion of the shifting bulk, prior to delivery.  (91D-H).\u000a

aVguise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services. The alleged scheme (the scheme) was for the stolen monies to be paid out by Dubal to Richco under the Richco consultancy agreement and then onpaid by Richco under subsidiary consultancy agreements made between Richco and companies which were the creatures of Mr Salaam (the subsidiary agreements). I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious. Dubal's business, as its full name implies, is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai. \u000a
p416
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p417
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p418
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a
p419
aV Q. How could it possibly have been all right for Dubal to pay, through these bogus transactions, Mr Tajir's travel expenses? What did they have to do with Dubal? \u000a
p420
aV Q. So would it have been possible simply to, for example look at this transaction, openly write a cheque for $2.6 million in favour of M & F Engineering against an entry in the company's books Reimbursement of Mr Tajir's travel expenses?\u000a
p421
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p422
aV...I did not even realise that any separate monies had been paid purportedly connected with this transaction by Richco, simply because monies had been paid to Altajir Limited anonymously and distributed without reference to me. As we were always receiving large sums of money from Richco during this period, and I did not handle specific or detailed accounts of the companies in which I was involved, (instead delegating these duties to respective managers , employees and members of family, etc.), I saw no reason to chase Marc Rich when I knew from a global point of view of all Altajir's family businesses that huge sums were coming in from Richco. This encompassed all businesses with Richco, including business ventures other than Dubal, including commodity trading with Iran...hundreds of millions of pounds were going through numerous companies connected with the Altajir family....\u000a
p423
aV In effect, therefore, his evidence was to distance himself from both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and indeed from the whole transaction. \u000a
p424
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p425
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p426
aV I therefore find that I am not assisted in this context by Mr El Fadl's report. I would merely add that, if I had received compelling evidence, tested under cross-examination, that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned, I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland, evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law, and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland, England and the USA. As it is, that question does not arise. \u000a
p427
aV Sixthly, the invidious and entirely false position that Mr Livingstone found himself to be in, as paymaster, as it were, can be illustrated by the occasions when he was left to organise what he himself accepted were totally bogus transactions, such as the September 1988 option for $3,000,000 and the December 1988 option for $2,600,000. \u000a
p428
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a
p429
aV Thus the first group emphasised what Ferris J had said in K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 149G, in the context of a third party claim, by a defendant accused of fraud, against the plaintiff's own accountant, who, the defendant alleged, had negligently failed to warn the plaintiff of the dangers inherent in the defendant's transactions:\u000a
p430
aV It seems that although the matter is regarded by GOFF and JONES, The Law of Restitution, 4th Edition, 1993, at 329, as an open question or even subject to a prohibition on the enforcement of an illegal transaction, there has now been authority that a defence of \u000a
p431
aVdoes not run in a contribution claim under the Act: see K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 148H/149B. Moreover, in Downs v. Chappell the court of appeal awarded contribution in favour of the fraudulent against the merely negligent. In any event, it does not seem to me that I am being asked to enforce an illegal transaction. \u000a
p432
aVThe only case against him is that, during the period covered by these transactions, he was in partnership as a solicitor with the other defendant. He took no part in them, and was ignorant of their nature. In my opinion, it is not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in such a business that he should so act as to make himself a constructive trustee, and thereby subject his partner to the same liability.\u000a
p433
aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a
p434
aVguise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services. The alleged scheme (the scheme) was for the stolen monies to be paid out by Dubal to Richco under the Richco consultancy agreement and then onpaid by Richco under subsidiary consultancy agreements made between Richco and companies which were the creatures of Mr Salaam (the subsidiary agreements). I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious. Dubal's business, as its full name implies, is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai. \u000a
p435
aV Mr Livingstone was not a defendant to these proceedings because an earlier action brought by Dubal in this court in 1995 against him (and his wife and companies) in respect of not only the scheme presently complained of but also other matters arising out of the period of his office with Dubal ended in an agreement dated 31 January 1996 under which he paid to Dubal, while denying liability, some $15,540,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims. Dubal alleged that $6,327,918.09 of that settlement was to be referred to the scheme, being the alleged total of all sums received by Mr Livingstone pursuant to it. Dubal's claim in this action started out therefore in the sum of the remaining balance of $43,789,703.91 (ie $50,117,622 less $6,327,918.09), together with interest and costs. I shall refer to this settlement as the Livingstone settlement.\u000a
p436
aV There are two other third parties, each of whom might perhaps have been made defendants at the suit of Dubal, but had not. One is Richco itself, the second third party, now, following a management buy-out, renamed Glencore International AG. I shall nevertheless continue to call that company Richco. Dubal had reached its own accommodations with Richco, is still in business relations with it, and made no allegations against it in these proceedings. Indeed, it had granted Richco indemnities against any loss, liability or expense, including costs, which Richco might suffer by reason of its involvement in this action, and had itself relied on the evidence, called by Richco, of Mr William Strothotte, the architect of the management buy-out and now Richco's chief executive. The reason why Richco had been brought into these proceedings was that first the Amhurst defendants, and next the Salaam defendants served third party notices on it, saying in effect that if, which was denied, there was any validity in Dubal's claim, then Richco too was a knowing participant in the scheme and ought to contribute to any ultimate liability. As part of the Amhurst settlement in the course of trial, it was also agreed that the Amhurst defendants would drop their third party claim against Richco. From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a
p437

He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative.

p439
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p440
aV The Salaam settlement was in the total sum of $18,000,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims against the Salaam defendants in this action. Of that sum, $3,000,000 had already been paid on 2 April 1998, a further $6,000,000 was paid on 1 June 1998 itself, a further $3,000,000 was to be paid within 90 days of 27 May 1998 - by my calculation by 25 August 1998, and the final instalment of $6,000,000 was to be paid by 31 December 1999. \u000a
p441
aVThere is no issue in this action as to the merits or otherwise of the GRC management agreement. Its significance to the issues in this action lies...in the dealings between Mr Salaam, Mr Amhurst and Mr Livingstone in relation to GRC; and...in the circumstances in which it came to an end...\u000a
p442
aV What then were those dealings and circumstances? First, Mr Livingstone was a director of GRC. It might seem surprising that that was so, since Mr Livingstone was the chief executive of the employer of GRC under the management agreement, and there was obvious potential for conflict of interest. Later, in March 1982, Mr Amhurst became a director and secretary of GRC. It is plain that Mr Salaam benefitted from the employment of his company as Dubal's manager, and so did Mr Livingstone. In its action against Mr Livingstone, one of the matters Dubal complained of was his illicit receipt of sums under the GRC agreement. Moreover, in cross-examination both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone said that Mr Al Tajir also benefitted from the GRC agreement. Mr Livingstone's cross-examination by Mr Seymour on behalf of Dubal contained this passage (on day 10 at 88/91):\u000a
p443
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a
p444
aV Q. How could it possibly have been all right for Dubal to pay, through these bogus transactions, Mr Tajir's travel expenses? What did they have to do with Dubal? \u000a
p445
aV Q. So would it have been possible simply to, for example look at this transaction, openly write a cheque for $2.6 million in favour of M & F Engineering against an entry in the company's books Reimbursement of Mr Tajir's travel expenses?\u000a
p446
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project.

p448
aV As for Mr Saad Salaam, Saad had requested him on one occasion to ask Mr Salaam to honour a long standing business arrangement between the brothers, whereby Saad was to receive a share of the profits of any business in the Gulf. He acted on that request, but without involving himself in any details, and subsequently learned from Saad that the matter had been resolved to his satisfaction. \u000a
p449
aV In effect, therefore, his evidence was to distance himself from both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and indeed from the whole transaction. \u000a
p450
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p451
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p452
aV The second requirement, as it seems to me, was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin (supra, 1971 AC 356, 397) - would provide a defence to the AMF's cause of action; or - as it might, perhaps, be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee. If, as the authorities show, the basis of such a claim is dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of the defendant, then it must be right to judge honesty or dishonesty in the light of all relevant circumstances; and those circumstances must include relevant provisions of the local law.\u000a

aV Ultimately, therefore, the only issue of law I had to decide in respect of the main action was as to the appropriate test of dishonesty: and I have decided that by adopting the test in Tan. As it is, Dubal made it clear that, while it only had to meet the test in Tan, what it alleged against Mr Salaam was actual dishonesty, the subjective knowledge that what he was participating in was dishonest theft.\u000a
p454
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p455
aV I therefore find that I am not assisted in this context by Mr El Fadl's report. I would merely add that, if I had received compelling evidence, tested under cross-examination, that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned, I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland, evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law, and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland, England and the USA. As it is, that question does not arise. \u000a
p456
aV In my judgment, the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai. That was ultimately the alleged basis of the legitimacy of the scheme as a whole and his participation in it. It was not in the end alleged that the scheme - and certainly not the scheme as I have found it to be, with only a small fraction of Dubal's total expenditure remaining in Richco's hands - was within his ordinary or even extraordinary powers as chief executive of Dubal, or within his powers of attorney. There was no separate part of the final submissions on behalf of either Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone that sought to submit that he had acted in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he had acted with the authority of Mr Tajir. Moreover, there was no submission in any event, nor of course could there be, that Mr Livingstone was acting in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he was acting honestly. I regret to say, however, that in my judgment he was acting dishonestly. I say so for the following reasons.\u000a
p457
aV Fourthly, there was the background of his participation in the GRC management agreement. Even if that agreement began its life in the era of Mr Al Tajir's ascendancy, it came to an end after he had resigned his official position as the Ruler's representative, and in my judgment those two matters were not unconnected. I cannot accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai, that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal, and that the creaming off of Dubal's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate. As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit, the GRC agreement was a means of abstracting cash from Dubal, and involved the theft of money from Dubal (If you wish to put it that way). In my judgment, the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were, with Mr Livingstone's dishonest complicity, in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal's money: for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco. Under the Richco scheme, no one at Dubal, except for Mr Livingstone himself, was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000a
p458
aV Sixthly, the invidious and entirely false position that Mr Livingstone found himself to be in, as paymaster, as it were, can be illustrated by the occasions when he was left to organise what he himself accepted were totally bogus transactions, such as the September 1988 option for $3,000,000 and the December 1988 option for $2,600,000. \u000a
p459
aV It was submitted on his behalf that unless I could find that the Richco consultancy agreement was itself a sham, then Dubal's claim must fail; and that it was impossible to find it to have been a sham in the light of Mr Strothotte's evidence that Richco intended to and did provide real services to Dubal under it. In my judgment, however, that submission is mistaken. Whether or not Richco did intend to provide or did provide any services to Dubal under the consultancy agreement (as distinct from the other agreements entered into between Richco and Dubal) seems to me to be ultimately beside the point. At most, Richco was expected to retain only a small fraction of the 2.5% commission and none of the other fees. The whole of the balance was paid over under the subsidiary agreements, which were on any view a total sham. In any event the scheme as a whole was thoroughly dishonest. Moreover, I would for my part regard the Richco consultancy agreement as itself a sham, even if Richco had been intended to retain its fraction of the monies paid over to it as recompense for any services: for the Richco consultancy agreement cannot be divorced from the scheme as a whole, together with the wholly spurious subsidiary agreements. As it is, I would in all the circumstances prefer to regard Richco's small retention under the scheme as its price for participating in the scheme, rather than as a genuine reward for providing services, of which there is no concrete evidence. I return to this matter below, under the heading of Richco.\u000a
p460
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a
p461
aV Thus the first group emphasised what Ferris J had said in K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 149G, in the context of a third party claim, by a defendant accused of fraud, against the plaintiff's own accountant, who, the defendant alleged, had negligently failed to warn the plaintiff of the dangers inherent in the defendant's transactions:\u000a
p462
aV It seems that although the matter is regarded by GOFF and JONES, The Law of Restitution, 4th Edition, 1993, at 329, as an open question or even subject to a prohibition on the enforcement of an illegal transaction, there has now been authority that a defence of \u000a
p463
aVdoes not run in a contribution claim under the Act: see K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 148H/149B. Moreover, in Downs v. Chappell the court of appeal awarded contribution in favour of the fraudulent against the merely negligent. In any event, it does not seem to me that I am being asked to enforce an illegal transaction. \u000a
p464
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p465
aVThe only case against him is that, during the period covered by these transactions, he was in partnership as a solicitor with the other defendant. He took no part in them, and was ignorant of their nature. In my opinion, it is not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in such a business that he should so act as to make himself a constructive trustee, and thereby subject his partner to the same liability.\u000a
p466
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a
p467
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a
p468
aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a
p469
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p470
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p471
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p472
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam.

p474
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p475
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a

p482
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p483
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a
p484
aV As for Mr Saad Salaam, Saad had requested him on one occasion to ask Mr Salaam to honour a long standing business arrangement between the brothers, whereby Saad was to receive a share of the profits of any business in the Gulf. He acted on that request, but without involving himself in any details, and subsequently learned from Saad that the matter had been resolved to his satisfaction. \u000a
p485
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue.

Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p486
aV In my judgment, the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai. That was ultimately the alleged basis of the legitimacy of the scheme as a whole and his participation in it. It was not in the end alleged that the scheme - and certainly not the scheme as I have found it to be, with only a small fraction of Dubal's total expenditure remaining in Richco's hands - was within his ordinary or even extraordinary powers as chief executive of Dubal, or within his powers of attorney. There was no separate part of the final submissions on behalf of either Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone that sought to submit that he had acted in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he had acted with the authority of Mr Tajir. Moreover, there was no submission in any event, nor of course could there be, that Mr Livingstone was acting in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he was acting honestly. I regret to say, however, that in my judgment he was acting dishonestly. I say so for the following reasons.\u000a
p487
aV Fourthly, there was the background of his participation in the GRC management agreement. Even if that agreement began its life in the era of Mr Al Tajir's ascendancy, it came to an end after he had resigned his official position as the Ruler's representative, and in my judgment those two matters were not unconnected. I cannot accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai, that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal, and that the creaming off of Dubal's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate. As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit, the GRC agreement was a means of abstracting cash from Dubal, and involved the theft of money from Dubal (If you wish to put it that way). In my judgment, the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were, with Mr Livingstone's dishonest complicity, in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal's money: for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco. Under the Richco scheme, no one at Dubal, except for Mr Livingstone himself, was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000a
p488
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p489
aVguise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services. The alleged scheme (the scheme) was for the stolen monies to be paid out by Dubal to Richco under the Richco consultancy agreement and then onpaid by Richco under subsidiary consultancy agreements made between Richco and companies which were the creatures of Mr Salaam (the subsidiary agreements). I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious. Dubal's business, as its full name implies, is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai. \u000a
p490
aV Mr Livingstone was not a defendant to these proceedings because an earlier action brought by Dubal in this court in 1995 against him (and his wife and companies) in respect of not only the scheme presently complained of but also other matters arising out of the period of his office with Dubal ended in an agreement dated 31 January 1996 under which he paid to Dubal, while denying liability, some $15,540,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims. Dubal alleged that $6,327,918.09 of that settlement was to be referred to the scheme, being the alleged total of all sums received by Mr Livingstone pursuant to it. Dubal's claim in this action started out therefore in the sum of the remaining balance of $43,789,703.91 (ie $50,117,622 less $6,327,918.09), together with interest and costs. I shall refer to this settlement as the Livingstone settlement.\u000a
p491
aV There are two other third parties, each of whom might perhaps have been made defendants at the suit of Dubal, but had not. One is Richco itself, the second third party, now, following a management buy-out, renamed Glencore International AG. I shall nevertheless continue to call that company Richco. Dubal had reached its own accommodations with Richco, is still in business relations with it, and made no allegations against it in these proceedings. Indeed, it had granted Richco indemnities against any loss, liability or expense, including costs, which Richco might suffer by reason of its involvement in this action, and had itself relied on the evidence, called by Richco, of Mr William Strothotte, the architect of the management buy-out and now Richco's chief executive. The reason why Richco had been brought into these proceedings was that first the Amhurst defendants, and next the Salaam defendants served third party notices on it, saying in effect that if, which was denied, there was any validity in Dubal's claim, then Richco too was a knowing participant in the scheme and ought to contribute to any ultimate liability. As part of the Amhurst settlement in the course of trial, it was also agreed that the Amhurst defendants would drop their third party claim against Richco. From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a
p492
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p493
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p494
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p495
aV The Salaam settlement was in the total sum of $18,000,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims against the Salaam defendants in this action. Of that sum, $3,000,000 had already been paid on 2 April 1998, a further $6,000,000 was paid on 1 June 1998 itself, a further $3,000,000 was to be paid within 90 days of 27 May 1998 - by my calculation by 25 August 1998, and the final instalment of $6,000,000 was to be paid by 31 December 1999. \u000a
p496
aVThere is no issue in this action as to the merits or otherwise of the GRC management agreement. Its significance to the issues in this action lies...in the dealings between Mr Salaam, Mr Amhurst and Mr Livingstone in relation to GRC; and...in the circumstances in which it came to an end...\u000a
p497
aV What then were those dealings and circumstances? First, Mr Livingstone was a director of GRC. It might seem surprising that that was so, since Mr Livingstone was the chief executive of the employer of GRC under the management agreement, and there was obvious potential for conflict of interest. Later, in March 1982, Mr Amhurst became a director and secretary of GRC. It is plain that Mr Salaam benefitted from the employment of his company as Dubal's manager, and so did Mr Livingstone. In its action against Mr Livingstone, one of the matters Dubal complained of was his illicit receipt of sums under the GRC agreement. Moreover, in cross-examination both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone said that Mr Al Tajir also benefitted from the GRC agreement. Mr Livingstone's cross-examination by Mr Seymour on behalf of Dubal contained this passage (on day 10 at 88/91):\u000a
p498
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a
p499
aV Q. How could it possibly have been all right for Dubal to pay, through these bogus transactions, Mr Tajir's travel expenses? What did they have to do with Dubal? \u000a
p500
aV Q. So would it have been possible simply to, for example look at this transaction, openly write a cheque for $2.6 million in favour of M & F Engineering against an entry in the company's books Reimbursement of Mr Tajir's travel expenses?\u000a
p501
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p502
aV...I did not even realise that any separate monies had been paid purportedly connected with this transaction by Richco, simply because monies had been paid to Altajir Limited anonymously and distributed without reference to me. As we were always receiving large sums of money from Richco during this period, and I did not handle specific or detailed accounts of the companies in which I was involved, (instead delegating these duties to respective managers , employees and members of family, etc.), I saw no reason to chase Marc Rich when I knew from a global point of view of all Altajir's family businesses that huge sums were coming in from Richco. This encompassed all businesses with Richco, including business ventures other than Dubal, including commodity trading with Iran...hundreds of millions of pounds were going through numerous companies connected with the Altajir family....\u000a
p503
aV As for Mr Saad Salaam, Saad had requested him on one occasion to ask Mr Salaam to honour a long standing business arrangement between the brothers, whereby Saad was to receive a share of the profits of any business in the Gulf. He acted on that request, but without involving himself in any details, and subsequently learned from Saad that the matter had been resolved to his satisfaction. \u000a
p504
aV In effect, therefore, his evidence was to distance himself from both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and indeed from the whole transaction. \u000a
p505
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p506
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p507
aV The second requirement, as it seems to me, was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin (supra, 1971 AC 356, 397) - would provide a defence to the AMF's cause of action; or - as it might, perhaps, be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee. If, as the authorities show, the basis of such a claim is dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of the defendant, then it must be right to judge honesty or dishonesty in the light of all relevant circumstances; and those circumstances must include relevant provisions of the local law.\u000a
p508
aV Ultimately, therefore, the only issue of law I had to decide in respect of the main action was as to the appropriate test of dishonesty: and I have decided that by adopting the test in Tan. As it is, Dubal made it clear that, while it only had to meet the test in Tan, what it alleged against Mr Salaam was actual dishonesty, the subjective knowledge that what he was participating in was dishonest theft.\u000a
p509
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p510
aV I therefore find that I am not assisted in this context by Mr El Fadl's report. I would merely add that, if I had received compelling evidence, tested under cross-examination, that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned, I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland, evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law, and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland, England and the USA. As it is, that question does not arise. \u000a
p511
aV In my judgment, the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai. That was ultimately the alleged basis of the legitimacy of the scheme as a whole and his participation in it. It was not in the end alleged that the scheme - and certainly not the scheme as I have found it to be, with only a small fraction of Dubal's total expenditure remaining in Richco's hands - was within his ordinary or even extraordinary powers as chief executive of Dubal, or within his powers of attorney. There was no separate part of the final submissions on behalf of either Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone that sought to submit that he had acted in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he had acted with the authority of Mr Tajir. Moreover, there was no submission in any event, nor of course could there be, that Mr Livingstone was acting in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he was acting honestly. I regret to say, however, that in my judgment he was acting dishonestly. I say so for the following reasons.\u000a
p512
aV Fourthly, there was the background of his participation in the GRC management agreement. Even if that agreement began its life in the era of Mr Al Tajir's ascendancy, it came to an end after he had resigned his official position as the Ruler's representative, and in my judgment those two matters were not unconnected. I cannot accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai, that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal, and that the creaming off of Dubal's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate. As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit, the GRC agreement was a means of abstracting cash from Dubal, and involved the theft of money from Dubal (If you wish to put it that way). In my judgment, the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were, with Mr Livingstone's dishonest complicity, in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal's money: for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco. Under the Richco scheme, no one at Dubal, except for Mr Livingstone himself, was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000a
p513
aV Sixthly, the invidious and entirely false position that Mr Livingstone found himself to be in, as paymaster, as it were, can be illustrated by the occasions when he was left to organise what he himself accepted were totally bogus transactions, such as the September 1988 option for $3,000,000 and the December 1988 option for $2,600,000. \u000a
p514
aV It was submitted on his behalf that unless I could find that the Richco consultancy agreement was itself a sham, then Dubal's claim must fail; and that it was impossible to find it to have been a sham in the light of Mr Strothotte's evidence that Richco intended to and did provide real services to Dubal under it. In my judgment, however, that submission is mistaken. Whether or not Richco did intend to provide or did provide any services to Dubal under the consultancy agreement (as distinct from the other agreements entered into between Richco and Dubal) seems to me to be ultimately beside the point. At most, Richco was expected to retain only a small fraction of the 2.5% commission and none of the other fees. The whole of the balance was paid over under the subsidiary agreements, which were on any view a total sham. In any event the scheme as a whole was thoroughly dishonest. Moreover, I would for my part regard the Richco consultancy agreement as itself a sham, even if Richco had been intended to retain its fraction of the monies paid over to it as recompense for any services: for the Richco consultancy agreement cannot be divorced from the scheme as a whole, together with the wholly spurious subsidiary agreements. As it is, I would in all the circumstances prefer to regard Richco's small retention under the scheme as its price for participating in the scheme, rather than as a genuine reward for providing services, of which there is no concrete evidence. I return to this matter below, under the heading of Richco.\u000a
p515
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a
p516
aV Thus the first group emphasised what Ferris J had said in K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 149G, in the context of a third party claim, by a defendant accused of fraud, against the plaintiff's own accountant, who, the defendant alleged, had negligently failed to warn the plaintiff of the dangers inherent in the defendant's transactions:\u000a
p517
aV It seems that although the matter is regarded by GOFF and JONES, The Law of Restitution, 4th Edition, 1993, at 329, as an open question or even subject to a prohibition on the enforcement of an illegal transaction, there has now been authority that a defence of \u000a
p518
aVdoes not run in a contribution claim under the Act: see K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 148H/149B. Moreover, in Downs v. Chappell the court of appeal awarded contribution in favour of the fraudulent against the merely negligent. In any event, it does not seem to me that I am being asked to enforce an illegal transaction. \u000a
p519
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p520
aVThe only case against him is that, during the period covered by these transactions, he was in partnership as a solicitor with the other defendant. He took no part in them, and was ignorant of their nature. In my opinion, it is not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in such a business that he should so act as to make himself a constructive trustee, and thereby subject his partner to the same liability.\u000a
p521
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a
p522
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a

aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a

aVguise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services. The alleged scheme (the scheme) was for the stolen monies to be paid out by Dubal to Richco under the Richco consultancy agreement and then onpaid by Richco under subsidiary consultancy agreements made between Richco and companies which were the creatures of Mr Salaam (the subsidiary agreements). I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious. Dubal's business, as its full name implies, is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai. \u000a
p525
aV Mr Livingstone was not a defendant to these proceedings because an earlier action brought by Dubal in this court in 1995 against him (and his wife and companies) in respect of not only the scheme presently complained of but also other matters arising out of the period of his office with Dubal ended in an agreement dated 31 January 1996 under which he paid to Dubal, while denying liability, some $15,540,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims. Dubal alleged that $6,327,918.09 of that settlement was to be referred to the scheme, being the alleged total of all sums received by Mr Livingstone pursuant to it. Dubal's claim in this action started out therefore in the sum of the remaining balance of $43,789,703.91 (ie $50,117,622 less $6,327,918.09), together with interest and costs. I shall refer to this settlement as the Livingstone settlement.\u000a
p526
aV There are two other third parties, each of whom might perhaps have been made defendants at the suit of Dubal, but had not. One is Richco itself, the second third party, now, following a management buy-out, renamed Glencore International AG. I shall nevertheless continue to call that company Richco. Dubal had reached its own accommodations with Richco, is still in business relations with it, and made no allegations against it in these proceedings. Indeed, it had granted Richco indemnities against any loss, liability or expense, including costs, which Richco might suffer by reason of its involvement in this action, and had itself relied on the evidence, called by Richco, of Mr William Strothotte, the architect of the management buy-out and now Richco's chief executive. The reason why Richco had been brought into these proceedings was that first the Amhurst defendants, and next the Salaam defendants served third party notices on it, saying in effect that if, which was denied, there was any validity in Dubal's claim, then Richco too was a knowing participant in the scheme and ought to contribute to any ultimate liability. As part of the Amhurst settlement in the course of trial, it was also agreed that the Amhurst defendants would drop their third party claim against Richco. From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a
p527
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p528
aVThere is no issue in this action as to the merits or otherwise of the GRC management agreement. Its significance to the issues in this action lies...in the dealings between Mr Salaam, Mr Amhurst and Mr Livingstone in relation to GRC; and...in the circumstances in which it came to an end...\u000a
p529
aVThe only case against him is that, during the period covered by these transactions, he was in partnership as a solicitor with the other defendant. He took no part in them, and was ignorant of their nature. In my opinion, it is not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in such a business that he should so act as to make himself a constructive trustee, and thereby subject his partner to the same liability.\u000a

aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p533
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p534
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a

aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a

In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p541
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p542
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p543
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a

As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p545
aV In effect, therefore, his evidence was to distance himself from both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and indeed from the whole transaction. \u000a
p546
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement.

I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p547
aV I therefore find that I am not assisted in this context by Mr El Fadl's report. I would merely add that, if I had received compelling evidence, tested under cross-examination, that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned, I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland, evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law, and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland, England and the USA. As it is, that question does not arise. \u000a
p548
aV It was submitted on his behalf that unless I could find that the Richco consultancy agreement was itself a sham, then Dubal's claim must fail; and that it was impossible to find it to have been a sham in the light of Mr Strothotte's evidence that Richco intended to and did provide real services to Dubal under it. In my judgment, however, that submission is mistaken. Whether or not Richco did intend to provide or did provide any services to Dubal under the consultancy agreement (as distinct from the other agreements entered into between Richco and Dubal) seems to me to be ultimately beside the point. At most, Richco was expected to retain only a small fraction of the 2.5% commission and none of the other fees. The whole of the balance was paid over under the subsidiary agreements, which were on any view a total sham. In any event the scheme as a whole was thoroughly dishonest. Moreover, I would for my part regard the Richco consultancy agreement as itself a sham, even if Richco had been intended to retain its fraction of the monies paid over to it as recompense for any services: for the Richco consultancy agreement cannot be divorced from the scheme as a whole, together with the wholly spurious subsidiary agreements. As it is, I would in all the circumstances prefer to regard Richco's small retention under the scheme as its price for participating in the scheme, rather than as a genuine reward for providing services, of which there is no concrete evidence. I return to this matter below, under the heading of Richco.\u000a
p549
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a

aV There are two other third parties, each of whom might perhaps have been made defendants at the suit of Dubal, but had not. One is Richco itself, the second third party, now, following a management buy-out, renamed Glencore International AG. I shall nevertheless continue to call that company Richco. Dubal had reached its own accommodations with Richco, is still in business relations with it, and made no allegations against it in these proceedings. Indeed, it had granted Richco indemnities against any loss, liability or expense, including costs, which Richco might suffer by reason of its involvement in this action, and had itself relied on the evidence, called by Richco, of Mr William Strothotte, the architect of the management buy-out and now Richco's chief executive. The reason why Richco had been brought into these proceedings was that first the Amhurst defendants, and next the Salaam defendants served third party notices on it, saying in effect that if, which was denied, there was any validity in Dubal's claim, then Richco too was a knowing participant in the scheme and ought to contribute to any ultimate liability. As part of the Amhurst settlement in the course of trial, it was also agreed that the Amhurst defendants would drop their third party claim against Richco. From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a
p551
aV...I did not even realise that any separate monies had been paid purportedly connected with this transaction by Richco, simply because monies had been paid to Altajir Limited anonymously and distributed without reference to me. As we were always receiving large sums of money from Richco during this period, and I did not handle specific or detailed accounts of the companies in which I was involved, (instead delegating these duties to respective managers , employees and members of family, etc.), I saw no reason to chase Marc Rich when I knew from a global point of view of all Altajir's family businesses that huge sums were coming in from Richco. This encompassed all businesses with Richco, including business ventures other than Dubal, including commodity trading with Iran...hundreds of millions of pounds were going through numerous companies connected with the Altajir family....\u000a
p552
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p553
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p554
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p555
aV In my judgment, the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai. That was ultimately the alleged basis of the legitimacy of the scheme as a whole and his participation in it. It was not in the end alleged that the scheme - and certainly not the scheme as I have found it to be, with only a small fraction of Dubal's total expenditure remaining in Richco's hands - was within his ordinary or even extraordinary powers as chief executive of Dubal, or within his powers of attorney. There was no separate part of the final submissions on behalf of either Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone that sought to submit that he had acted in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he had acted with the authority of Mr Tajir. Moreover, there was no submission in any event, nor of course could there be, that Mr Livingstone was acting in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he was acting honestly. I regret to say, however, that in my judgment he was acting dishonestly. I say so for the following reasons.\u000a
p556
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p557
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a

aVguise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services. The alleged scheme (the scheme) was for the stolen monies to be paid out by Dubal to Richco under the Richco consultancy agreement and then onpaid by Richco under subsidiary consultancy agreements made between Richco and companies which were the creatures of Mr Salaam (the subsidiary agreements). I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious. Dubal's business, as its full name implies, is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai. \u000a
p559
aV Mr Livingstone was not a defendant to these proceedings because an earlier action brought by Dubal in this court in 1995 against him (and his wife and companies) in respect of not only the scheme presently complained of but also other matters arising out of the period of his office with Dubal ended in an agreement dated 31 January 1996 under which he paid to Dubal, while denying liability, some $15,540,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims. Dubal alleged that $6,327,918.09 of that settlement was to be referred to the scheme, being the alleged total of all sums received by Mr Livingstone pursuant to it. Dubal's claim in this action started out therefore in the sum of the remaining balance of $43,789,703.91 (ie $50,117,622 less $6,327,918.09), together with interest and costs. I shall refer to this settlement as the Livingstone settlement.\u000a

aV The second requirement, as it seems to me, was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin (supra, 1971 AC 356, 397) - would provide a defence to the AMF's cause of action; or - as it might, perhaps, be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee. If, as the authorities show, the basis of such a claim is dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of the defendant, then it must be right to judge honesty or dishonesty in the light of all relevant circumstances; and those circumstances must include relevant provisions of the local law.\u000a

p564
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a
p565
aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a

From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a
p573
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p574
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p575
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p576
aV The Salaam settlement was in the total sum of $18,000,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims against the Salaam defendants in this action. Of that sum, $3,000,000 had already been paid on 2 April 1998, a further $6,000,000 was paid on 1 June 1998 itself, a further $3,000,000 was to be paid within 90 days of 27 May 1998 - by my calculation by 25 August 1998, and the final instalment of $6,000,000 was to be paid by 31 December 1999. \u000a
p577
aVThere is no issue in this action as to the merits or otherwise of the GRC management agreement. Its significance to the issues in this action lies...in the dealings between Mr Salaam, Mr Amhurst and Mr Livingstone in relation to GRC; and...in the circumstances in which it came to an end...\u000a
p578
aV What then were those dealings and circumstances? First, Mr Livingstone was a director of GRC. It might seem surprising that that was so, since Mr Livingstone was the chief executive of the employer of GRC under the management agreement, and there was obvious potential for conflict of interest. Later, in March 1982, Mr Amhurst became a director and secretary of GRC. It is plain that Mr Salaam benefitted from the employment of his company as Dubal's manager, and so did Mr Livingstone. In its action against Mr Livingstone, one of the matters Dubal complained of was his illicit receipt of sums under the GRC agreement. Moreover, in cross-examination both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone said that Mr Al Tajir also benefitted from the GRC agreement. Mr Livingstone's cross-examination by Mr Seymour on behalf of Dubal contained this passage (on day 10 at 88/91):\u000a
p579
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a
p580
aV Q. How could it possibly have been all right for Dubal to pay, through these bogus transactions, Mr Tajir's travel expenses? What did they have to do with Dubal? \u000a
p581
aV Q. So would it have been possible simply to, for example look at this transaction, openly write a cheque for $2.6 million in favour of M & F Engineering against an entry in the company's books Reimbursement of Mr Tajir's travel expenses?\u000a

aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p583
aV...I did not even realise that any separate monies had been paid purportedly connected with this transaction by Richco, simply because monies had been paid to Altajir Limited anonymously and distributed without reference to me. As we were always receiving large sums of money from Richco during this period, and I did not handle specific or detailed accounts of the companies in which I was involved, (instead delegating these duties to respective managers , employees and members of family, etc.), I saw no reason to chase Marc Rich when I knew from a global point of view of all Altajir's family businesses that huge sums were coming in from Richco. This encompassed all businesses with Richco, including business ventures other than Dubal, including commodity trading with Iran...hundreds of millions of pounds were going through numerous companies connected with the Altajir family....\u000a
p584
aV As for Mr Saad Salaam, Saad had requested him on one occasion to ask Mr Salaam to honour a long standing business arrangement between the brothers, whereby Saad was to receive a share of the profits of any business in the Gulf. He acted on that request, but without involving himself in any details, and subsequently learned from Saad that the matter had been resolved to his satisfaction. \u000a
p585
aV In effect, therefore, his evidence was to distance himself from both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and indeed from the whole transaction. \u000a
p586
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p587
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p588
aV The second requirement, as it seems to me, was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin (supra, 1971 AC 356, 397) - would provide a defence to the AMF's cause of action; or - as it might, perhaps, be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee. If, as the authorities show, the basis of such a claim is dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of the defendant, then it must be right to judge honesty or dishonesty in the light of all relevant circumstances; and those circumstances must include relevant provisions of the local law.\u000a
p589
aV Ultimately, therefore, the only issue of law I had to decide in respect of the main action was as to the appropriate test of dishonesty: and I have decided that by adopting the test in Tan. As it is, Dubal made it clear that, while it only had to meet the test in Tan, what it alleged against Mr Salaam was actual dishonesty, the subjective knowledge that what he was participating in was dishonest theft.\u000a
p590
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p591
aV I therefore find that I am not assisted in this context by Mr El Fadl's report. I would merely add that, if I had received compelling evidence, tested under cross-examination, that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned, I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland, evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law, and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland, England and the USA. As it is, that question does not arise. \u000a
p592
aV In my judgment, the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai. That was ultimately the alleged basis of the legitimacy of the scheme as a whole and his participation in it. It was not in the end alleged that the scheme - and certainly not the scheme as I have found it to be, with only a small fraction of Dubal's total expenditure remaining in Richco's hands - was within his ordinary or even extraordinary powers as chief executive of Dubal, or within his powers of attorney. There was no separate part of the final submissions on behalf of either Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone that sought to submit that he had acted in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he had acted with the authority of Mr Tajir. Moreover, there was no submission in any event, nor of course could there be, that Mr Livingstone was acting in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he was acting honestly. I regret to say, however, that in my judgment he was acting dishonestly. I say so for the following reasons.\u000a
p593
aV Fourthly, there was the background of his participation in the GRC management agreement. Even if that agreement began its life in the era of Mr Al Tajir's ascendancy, it came to an end after he had resigned his official position as the Ruler's representative, and in my judgment those two matters were not unconnected. I cannot accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai, that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal, and that the creaming off of Dubal's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate. As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit, the GRC agreement was a means of abstracting cash from Dubal, and involved the theft of money from Dubal (If you wish to put it that way). In my judgment, the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were, with Mr Livingstone's dishonest complicity, in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal's money: for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco. Under the Richco scheme, no one at Dubal, except for Mr Livingstone himself, was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000a
p594
aV Sixthly, the invidious and entirely false position that Mr Livingstone found himself to be in, as paymaster, as it were, can be illustrated by the occasions when he was left to organise what he himself accepted were totally bogus transactions, such as the September 1988 option for $3,000,000 and the December 1988 option for $2,600,000. \u000a
p595
aV It was submitted on his behalf that unless I could find that the Richco consultancy agreement was itself a sham, then Dubal's claim must fail; and that it was impossible to find it to have been a sham in the light of Mr Strothotte's evidence that Richco intended to and did provide real services to Dubal under it. In my judgment, however, that submission is mistaken. Whether or not Richco did intend to provide or did provide any services to Dubal under the consultancy agreement (as distinct from the other agreements entered into between Richco and Dubal) seems to me to be ultimately beside the point. At most, Richco was expected to retain only a small fraction of the 2.5% commission and none of the other fees. The whole of the balance was paid over under the subsidiary agreements, which were on any view a total sham. In any event the scheme as a whole was thoroughly dishonest. Moreover, I would for my part regard the Richco consultancy agreement as itself a sham, even if Richco had been intended to retain its fraction of the monies paid over to it as recompense for any services: for the Richco consultancy agreement cannot be divorced from the scheme as a whole, together with the wholly spurious subsidiary agreements. As it is, I would in all the circumstances prefer to regard Richco's small retention under the scheme as its price for participating in the scheme, rather than as a genuine reward for providing services, of which there is no concrete evidence. I return to this matter below, under the heading of Richco.\u000a
p596
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a
p597
aV Thus the first group emphasised what Ferris J had said in K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 149G, in the context of a third party claim, by a defendant accused of fraud, against the plaintiff's own accountant, who, the defendant alleged, had negligently failed to warn the plaintiff of the dangers inherent in the defendant's transactions:\u000a
p598
aV It seems that although the matter is regarded by GOFF and JONES, The Law of Restitution, 4th Edition, 1993, at 329, as an open question or even subject to a prohibition on the enforcement of an illegal transaction, there has now been authority that a defence of \u000a
p599
aVdoes not run in a contribution claim under the Act: see K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 148H/149B. Moreover, in Downs v. Chappell the court of appeal awarded contribution in favour of the fraudulent against the merely negligent. In any event, it does not seem to me that I am being asked to enforce an illegal transaction. \u000a
p600
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p601
aVThe only case against him is that, during the period covered by these transactions, he was in partnership as a solicitor with the other defendant. He took no part in them, and was ignorant of their nature. In my opinion, it is not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in such a business that he should so act as to make himself a constructive trustee, and thereby subject his partner to the same liability.\u000a
p602
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a
p603
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a
p604
aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a
p605
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p606
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p607

aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p609
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam.

p612
aV There are two other third parties, each of whom might perhaps have been made defendants at the suit of Dubal, but had not. One is Richco itself, the second third party, now, following a management buy-out, renamed Glencore International AG. I shall nevertheless continue to call that company Richco. Dubal had reached its own accommodations with Richco, is still in business relations with it, and made no allegations against it in these proceedings. Indeed, it had granted Richco indemnities against any loss, liability or expense, including costs, which Richco might suffer by reason of its involvement in this action, and had itself relied on the evidence, called by Richco, of Mr William Strothotte, the architect of the management buy-out and now Richco's chief executive. The reason why Richco had been brought into these proceedings was that first the Amhurst defendants, and next the Salaam defendants served third party notices on it, saying in effect that if, which was denied, there was any validity in Dubal's claim, then Richco too was a knowing participant in the scheme and ought to contribute to any ultimate liability. As part of the Amhurst settlement in the course of trial, it was also agreed that the Amhurst defendants would drop their third party claim against Richco. From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a
p613
aV What then were those dealings and circumstances? First, Mr Livingstone was a director of GRC. It might seem surprising that that was so, since Mr Livingstone was the chief executive of the employer of GRC under the management agreement, and there was obvious potential for conflict of interest. Later, in March 1982, Mr Amhurst became a director and secretary of GRC. It is plain that Mr Salaam benefitted from the employment of his company as Dubal's manager, and so did Mr Livingstone. In its action against Mr Livingstone, one of the matters Dubal complained of was his illicit receipt of sums under the GRC agreement. Moreover, in cross-examination both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone said that Mr Al Tajir also benefitted from the GRC agreement. Mr Livingstone's cross-examination by Mr Seymour on behalf of Dubal contained this passage (on day 10 at 88/91):\u000a
p614
aV Q. So would it have been possible simply to, for example look at this transaction, openly write a cheque for $2.6 million in favour of M & F Engineering against an entry in the company's books Reimbursement of Mr Tajir's travel expenses?\u000a

It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p616
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p617
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p618
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a
p619
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p620
aVguise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services. The alleged scheme (the scheme) was for the stolen monies to be paid out by Dubal to Richco under the Richco consultancy agreement and then onpaid by Richco under subsidiary consultancy agreements made between Richco and companies which were the creatures of Mr Salaam (the subsidiary agreements). I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious. Dubal's business, as its full name implies, is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai. \u000a
p621
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p622
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a
p623
aV The second requirement, as it seems to me, was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin (supra, 1971 AC 356, 397) - would provide a defence to the AMF's cause of action; or - as it might, perhaps, be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee. If, as the authorities show, the basis of such a claim is dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of the defendant, then it must be right to judge honesty or dishonesty in the light of all relevant circumstances; and those circumstances must include relevant provisions of the local law.\u000a
p624
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a
p625
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p626
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a

aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a

p636
aV There are two other third parties, each of whom might perhaps have been made defendants at the suit of Dubal, but had not. One is Richco itself, the second third party, now, following a management buy-out, renamed Glencore International AG. I shall nevertheless continue to call that company Richco. Dubal had reached its own accommodations with Richco, is still in business relations with it, and made no allegations against it in these proceedings. Indeed, it had granted Richco indemnities against any loss, liability or expense, including costs, which Richco might suffer by reason of its involvement in this action, and had itself relied on the evidence, called by Richco, of Mr William Strothotte, the architect of the management buy-out and now Richco's chief executive. The reason why Richco had been brought into these proceedings was that first the Amhurst defendants, and next the Salaam defendants served third party notices on it, saying in effect that if, which was denied, there was any validity in Dubal's claim, then Richco too was a knowing participant in the scheme and ought to contribute to any ultimate liability. As part of the Amhurst settlement in the course of trial, it was also agreed that the Amhurst defendants would drop their third party claim against Richco. From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a

p638
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p639
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a
p640
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p641
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p642
aV The second requirement, as it seems to me, was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin (supra, 1971 AC 356, 397) - would provide a defence to the AMF's cause of action; or - as it might, perhaps, be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee. If, as the authorities show, the basis of such a claim is dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of the defendant, then it must be right to judge honesty or dishonesty in the light of all relevant circumstances; and those circumstances must include relevant provisions of the local law.\u000a
p643
aV Ultimately, therefore, the only issue of law I had to decide in respect of the main action was as to the appropriate test of dishonesty: and I have decided that by adopting the test in Tan. As it is, Dubal made it clear that, while it only had to meet the test in Tan, what it alleged against Mr Salaam was actual dishonesty, the subjective knowledge that what he was participating in was dishonest theft.\u000a
p644
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p645
aV I therefore find that I am not assisted in this context by Mr El Fadl's report. I would merely add that, if I had received compelling evidence, tested under cross-examination, that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned, I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland, evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law, and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland, England and the USA. As it is, that question does not arise. \u000a
p646
aV In my judgment, the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai. That was ultimately the alleged basis of the legitimacy of the scheme as a whole and his participation in it. It was not in the end alleged that the scheme - and certainly not the scheme as I have found it to be, with only a small fraction of Dubal's total expenditure remaining in Richco's hands - was within his ordinary or even extraordinary powers as chief executive of Dubal, or within his powers of attorney. There was no separate part of the final submissions on behalf of either Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone that sought to submit that he had acted in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he had acted with the authority of Mr Tajir. Moreover, there was no submission in any event, nor of course could there be, that Mr Livingstone was acting in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he was acting honestly. I regret to say, however, that in my judgment he was acting dishonestly. I say so for the following reasons.\u000a
p647
aV Fourthly, there was the background of his participation in the GRC management agreement. Even if that agreement began its life in the era of Mr Al Tajir's ascendancy, it came to an end after he had resigned his official position as the Ruler's representative, and in my judgment those two matters were not unconnected. I cannot accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai, that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal, and that the creaming off of Dubal's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate. As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit, the GRC agreement was a means of abstracting cash from Dubal, and involved the theft of money from Dubal (If you wish to put it that way). In my judgment, the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were, with Mr Livingstone's dishonest complicity, in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal's money: for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco. Under the Richco scheme, no one at Dubal, except for Mr Livingstone himself, was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000a
p648
aV It was submitted on his behalf that unless I could find that the Richco consultancy agreement was itself a sham, then Dubal's claim must fail; and that it was impossible to find it to have been a sham in the light of Mr Strothotte's evidence that Richco intended to and did provide real services to Dubal under it. In my judgment, however, that submission is mistaken. Whether or not Richco did intend to provide or did provide any services to Dubal under the consultancy agreement (as distinct from the other agreements entered into between Richco and Dubal) seems to me to be ultimately beside the point. At most, Richco was expected to retain only a small fraction of the 2.5% commission and none of the other fees. The whole of the balance was paid over under the subsidiary agreements, which were on any view a total sham. In any event the scheme as a whole was thoroughly dishonest. Moreover, I would for my part regard the Richco consultancy agreement as itself a sham, even if Richco had been intended to retain its fraction of the monies paid over to it as recompense for any services: for the Richco consultancy agreement cannot be divorced from the scheme as a whole, together with the wholly spurious subsidiary agreements. As it is, I would in all the circumstances prefer to regard Richco's small retention under the scheme as its price for participating in the scheme, rather than as a genuine reward for providing services, of which there is no concrete evidence. I return to this matter below, under the heading of Richco.\u000a
p649
aV Thus the first group emphasised what Ferris J had said in K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 149G, in the context of a third party claim, by a defendant accused of fraud, against the plaintiff's own accountant, who, the defendant alleged, had negligently failed to warn the plaintiff of the dangers inherent in the defendant's transactions:\u000a
p650
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p651
aVThe only case against him is that, during the period covered by these transactions, he was in partnership as a solicitor with the other defendant. He took no part in them, and was ignorant of their nature. In my opinion, it is not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in such a business that he should so act as to make himself a constructive trustee, and thereby subject his partner to the same liability.\u000a
p652
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a
p653
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a
p654
aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a
p655
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p656

p659
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a

I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious.

aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a

That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a

aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a

aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p676
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p677
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a

aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p680
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a
p681
aV Fourthly, there was the background of his participation in the GRC management agreement. Even if that agreement began its life in the era of Mr Al Tajir's ascendancy, it came to an end after he had resigned his official position as the Ruler's representative, and in my judgment those two matters were not unconnected. I cannot accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai, that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal, and that the creaming off of Dubal's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate. As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit, the GRC agreement was a means of abstracting cash from Dubal, and involved the theft of money from Dubal (If you wish to put it that way). In my judgment, the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were, with Mr Livingstone's dishonest complicity, in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal's money: for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco. Under the Richco scheme, no one at Dubal, except for Mr Livingstone himself, was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000a

aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned. It was contemplated that submissions in the latter proceedings could not conveniently be addressed, in effect would have to be addressed on too many possible contingencies all of which would be unnecessary if I found wholly in favour of the defendants, for those submissions to take place at the same time as submissions in the main action. It was therefore contemplated that, when my findings of fact over the whole spectrum of the evidence and my decisions in the main action were known, the parties would then proceed, if necessary, to a second hearing for the purpose of submissions in the third party and contribution proceedings. \u000a
p688
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a
p689
aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a
p690
aVguise of sham contracts for the purported provision of commercial services. The alleged scheme (the scheme) was for the stolen monies to be paid out by Dubal to Richco under the Richco consultancy agreement and then onpaid by Richco under subsidiary consultancy agreements made between Richco and companies which were the creatures of Mr Salaam (the subsidiary agreements). I shall adopt the conveniently short expression scheme, somewhat pejorative as it is, to refer to the transaction or series of transactions brought into existence and evidenced by the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements, irrespective of whether it was a dishonest scheme, as Dubal alleged, or an honest scheme, as the defendants alleged, because the expression was so used, as a matter of convenience, at trial, because circumlocutions to describe the transactions in terms which reflected the parties' respective evidence and submissions would create difficulties, and also because Dubal's preferred talk of theft, even in the phrase alleged theft, is of course even more tendentious. Dubal's business, as its full name implies, is the operation of an aluminium smelter in Dubai. \u000a
p691
aV Mr Livingstone was not a defendant to these proceedings because an earlier action brought by Dubal in this court in 1995 against him (and his wife and companies) in respect of not only the scheme presently complained of but also other matters arising out of the period of his office with Dubal ended in an agreement dated 31 January 1996 under which he paid to Dubal, while denying liability, some $15,540,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims. Dubal alleged that $6,327,918.09 of that settlement was to be referred to the scheme, being the alleged total of all sums received by Mr Livingstone pursuant to it. Dubal's claim in this action started out therefore in the sum of the remaining balance of $43,789,703.91 (ie $50,117,622 less $6,327,918.09), together with interest and costs. I shall refer to this settlement as the Livingstone settlement.\u000a
p692
aV There are two other third parties, each of whom might perhaps have been made defendants at the suit of Dubal, but had not. One is Richco itself, the second third party, now, following a management buy-out, renamed Glencore International AG. I shall nevertheless continue to call that company Richco. Dubal had reached its own accommodations with Richco, is still in business relations with it, and made no allegations against it in these proceedings. Indeed, it had granted Richco indemnities against any loss, liability or expense, including costs, which Richco might suffer by reason of its involvement in this action, and had itself relied on the evidence, called by Richco, of Mr William Strothotte, the architect of the management buy-out and now Richco's chief executive. The reason why Richco had been brought into these proceedings was that first the Amhurst defendants, and next the Salaam defendants served third party notices on it, saying in effect that if, which was denied, there was any validity in Dubal's claim, then Richco too was a knowing participant in the scheme and ought to contribute to any ultimate liability. As part of the Amhurst settlement in the course of trial, it was also agreed that the Amhurst defendants would drop their third party claim against Richco. From that point, only the Salaam defendants maintained a claim that Richco was knowingly and therefore dishonestly implicated in the scheme. \u000a
p693
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p694
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p695
aV It had been agreed between the parties, and so ordered, that the trial would take place in two parts. In the first part, all evidence which any of the parties might wish to call whether relevant to the main action or the third party and contribution proceedings would be called, and submissions would be made so far as was relevant to the main action, but not so far as the third party and contribution proceedings were concerned.

aV The Salaam settlement was in the total sum of $18,000,000 in full and final settlement of all Dubal's claims against the Salaam defendants in this action. Of that sum, $3,000,000 had already been paid on 2 April 1998, a further $6,000,000 was paid on 1 June 1998 itself, a further $3,000,000 was to be paid within 90 days of 27 May 1998 - by my calculation by 25 August 1998, and the final instalment of $6,000,000 was to be paid by 31 December 1999. \u000a
p697
aVThere is no issue in this action as to the merits or otherwise of the GRC management agreement. Its significance to the issues in this action lies...in the dealings between Mr Salaam, Mr Amhurst and Mr Livingstone in relation to GRC; and...in the circumstances in which it came to an end...\u000a
p698
aV What then were those dealings and circumstances? First, Mr Livingstone was a director of GRC. It might seem surprising that that was so, since Mr Livingstone was the chief executive of the employer of GRC under the management agreement, and there was obvious potential for conflict of interest. Later, in March 1982, Mr Amhurst became a director and secretary of GRC. It is plain that Mr Salaam benefitted from the employment of his company as Dubal's manager, and so did Mr Livingstone. In its action against Mr Livingstone, one of the matters Dubal complained of was his illicit receipt of sums under the GRC agreement. Moreover, in cross-examination both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone said that Mr Al Tajir also benefitted from the GRC agreement. Mr Livingstone's cross-examination by Mr Seymour on behalf of Dubal contained this passage (on day 10 at 88/91):\u000a
p699
aV In my judgment, this was unsatisfactory evidence on a point which Dubal had flagged in its opening skeleton as of particular significance. Thus it was there submitted that as a result of the conversation on 11 March 1983 Mr Salaam knew that Mr Al Tajir was not in a position to give authorisation on the part of Dubal or the government of Dubai to any transactions, and in particular not in a position to authorise the payment of any commission to any one. I accept that submission: indeed, that was Mr Al Tajir's own evidence, as I have already mentioned.\u000a
p700
aV Q. How could it possibly have been all right for Dubal to pay, through these bogus transactions, Mr Tajir's travel expenses? What did they have to do with Dubal? \u000a
p701
aV Q. So would it have been possible simply to, for example look at this transaction, openly write a cheque for $2.6 million in favour of M & F Engineering against an entry in the company's books Reimbursement of Mr Tajir's travel expenses?\u000a
p702
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a

aV...I did not even realise that any separate monies had been paid purportedly connected with this transaction by Richco, simply because monies had been paid to Altajir Limited anonymously and distributed without reference to me. As we were always receiving large sums of money from Richco during this period, and I did not handle specific or detailed accounts of the companies in which I was involved, (instead delegating these duties to respective managers , employees and members of family, etc.), I saw no reason to chase Marc Rich when I knew from a global point of view of all Altajir's family businesses that huge sums were coming in from Richco. This encompassed all businesses with Richco, including business ventures other than Dubal, including commodity trading with Iran...hundreds of millions of pounds were going through numerous companies connected with the Altajir family....\u000a
p704
aV As for Mr Saad Salaam, Saad had requested him on one occasion to ask Mr Salaam to honour a long standing business arrangement between the brothers, whereby Saad was to receive a share of the profits of any business in the Gulf. He acted on that request, but without involving himself in any details, and subsequently learned from Saad that the matter had been resolved to his satisfaction. \u000a
p705
aV In effect, therefore, his evidence was to distance himself from both Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and indeed from the whole transaction. \u000a
p706
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction. One possible reason why the on-payments by Richco were divided between four subsidiary agreements was that Mr Al Tajir was not supposed to know about, and thus was not to share in, the payments generated outside the second version of the JMS agreement. It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset. If that is so, however, it is difficult to know why the JMS agreement in its first version did not reflect that agreement with Mr Al Tajir, or why the Wid agreement only entered at the stage of the second version of the JMS agreement; or, indeed, why Mr Al Tajir should have been prepared to forego any payment during the last three years of the Richco consultancy agreement - especially as that agreement might have continued evergreen for many more years than ten. I am left with a feeling of deep scepticism as to whether Mr Al Tajir was permitted to know all the ins and outs of the scheme as negotiated by Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone. The impression that I have is one that reflects the cut-throat defences of the three main protagonists before me: that theirs was a coming together of convenience, but not of candour; of intrigue, but not of integrity. \u000a
p707
aVIn most situations there is little difficulty in identifying how an honest person would behave. Honest people do not intentionally deceive others to their detriment. Honest people do not knowingly take others' property. Unless there is a very good and compelling reason, an honest person does not participate in a transaction if he knows it involves a misapplication of trust assets to the detriment of the beneficiaries. Not does an honest person in such a case deliberately close his eyes and ears, or deliberately not ask questions, lest he learn something he would rather not know, and then proceed regardless.\u000a
p708
aV The second requirement, as it seems to me, was that the English Court must have satisfied itself that there was no rule of law of any relevant foreign law which - in the words of Lord Pearson in Boys v. Chaplin (supra, 1971 AC 356, 397) - would provide a defence to the AMF's cause of action; or - as it might, perhaps, be put in the context of a Barnes v. Addy constructive trust claim - would make it inequitable to hold that an FNBC defendant should be treated as if it were a trustee. If, as the authorities show, the basis of such a claim is dishonesty or lack of probity on the part of the defendant, then it must be right to judge honesty or dishonesty in the light of all relevant circumstances; and those circumstances must include relevant provisions of the local law.\u000a
p709
aV Ultimately, therefore, the only issue of law I had to decide in respect of the main action was as to the appropriate test of dishonesty: and I have decided that by adopting the test in Tan. As it is, Dubal made it clear that, while it only had to meet the test in Tan, what it alleged against Mr Salaam was actual dishonesty, the subjective knowledge that what he was participating in was dishonest theft.\u000a
p710
aV Strictly speaking, the only person whose honesty was formally in question for the purpose of the main action, following the Amhurst settlement, was Mr Salaam. However, his position could not realistically be considered separately from those of Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir. Mr Livingstone's position had to be considered, also because it was a condition precedent of any liability in the main action that Mr Livingstone had acted in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Tan makes clear that a fiduciary may well be in breach without being himself dishonest: but for the purposes of the contribution proceedings the question of Mr Livingstone's honesty was itself in issue. For similar reasons Richco's honesty was in issue. The Amhurst defendants' honesty was no longer in issue after their settlement with Dubal: instead I had to proceed in their case on the assumption that what Dubal had factually pleaded against them was true. In effect therefore, I shall have to consider the parties' honesty or otherwise all of a piece. I must start, however, with Mr Livingstone: was he in breach of a fiduciary obligation? and if so, had he been dishonest? Before turning to those questions, however, I must say something more about Dubai custom and practice.\u000a
p711
aV I therefore find that I am not assisted in this context by Mr El Fadl's report. I would merely add that, if I had received compelling evidence, tested under cross-examination, that payments of the kind and size of the payments in this case were acceptable under Dubai custom and practice even in the absence of the clear consent of the owners of the business concerned, I would have had to consider to what extent such evidence was relevant to transactions for the most part negotiated in Switzerland, evidenced by agreements expressly made subject to English law, and performed by the making of payments in Switzerland, England and the USA. As it is, that question does not arise. \u000a
p712
aV In my judgment, the fact that he was in breach of his fiduciary duty to Dubal must follow from my rejection of the submission that in acting as he did he was acting with the authority of Mr Al Tajir as a representative of the Ruler of Dubai. That was ultimately the alleged basis of the legitimacy of the scheme as a whole and his participation in it. It was not in the end alleged that the scheme - and certainly not the scheme as I have found it to be, with only a small fraction of Dubal's total expenditure remaining in Richco's hands - was within his ordinary or even extraordinary powers as chief executive of Dubal, or within his powers of attorney. There was no separate part of the final submissions on behalf of either Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone that sought to submit that he had acted in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he had acted with the authority of Mr Tajir. Moreover, there was no submission in any event, nor of course could there be, that Mr Livingstone was acting in accordance with his fiduciary duty, unless he was acting honestly. I regret to say, however, that in my judgment he was acting dishonestly. I say so for the following reasons.\u000a
p713
aV Fourthly, there was the background of his participation in the GRC management agreement. Even if that agreement began its life in the era of Mr Al Tajir's ascendancy, it came to an end after he had resigned his official position as the Ruler's representative, and in my judgment those two matters were not unconnected. I cannot accept that Mr Livingstone was not aware that a new regime had come to power in Dubai, that that was reflected in a change in the power structure in Dubal, and that the creaming off of Dubal's funds by means of the GRC agreement was unacceptable in the new climate. As Mr Livingstone was at times candid enough to admit, the GRC agreement was a means of abstracting cash from Dubal, and involved the theft of money from Dubal (If you wish to put it that way). In my judgment, the Richco consultancy agreement and the subsidiary agreements were structured as they were, with Mr Livingstone's dishonest complicity, in order to disguise the fact that this scheme was but a further and more refined device for abstracting Dubal's money: for on this occasion the abstraction was to operate under the cloak of an apparently arms-length agreement with an independent partner in the form of Richco. Under the Richco scheme, no one at Dubal, except for Mr Livingstone himself, was supposed to know that most of the funds paid out by Dubal to Richco was to end up in the hands of Mr Livingstone and the other beneficiaries of the scheme.\u000a
p714
aV Sixthly, the invidious and entirely false position that Mr Livingstone found himself to be in, as paymaster, as it were, can be illustrated by the occasions when he was left to organise what he himself accepted were totally bogus transactions, such as the September 1988 option for $3,000,000 and the December 1988 option for $2,600,000. \u000a
p715
aV It was submitted on his behalf that unless I could find that the Richco consultancy agreement was itself a sham, then Dubal's claim must fail; and that it was impossible to find it to have been a sham in the light of Mr Strothotte's evidence that Richco intended to and did provide real services to Dubal under it. In my judgment, however, that submission is mistaken. Whether or not Richco did intend to provide or did provide any services to Dubal under the consultancy agreement (as distinct from the other agreements entered into between Richco and Dubal) seems to me to be ultimately beside the point. At most, Richco was expected to retain only a small fraction of the 2.5% commission and none of the other fees. The whole of the balance was paid over under the subsidiary agreements, which were on any view a total sham. In any event the scheme as a whole was thoroughly dishonest. Moreover, I would for my part regard the Richco consultancy agreement as itself a sham, even if Richco had been intended to retain its fraction of the monies paid over to it as recompense for any services: for the Richco consultancy agreement cannot be divorced from the scheme as a whole, together with the wholly spurious subsidiary agreements. As it is, I would in all the circumstances prefer to regard Richco's small retention under the scheme as its price for participating in the scheme, rather than as a genuine reward for providing services, of which there is no concrete evidence. I return to this matter below, under the heading of Richco.\u000a
p716
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a
p717
aV Thus the first group emphasised what Ferris J had said in K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 149G, in the context of a third party claim, by a defendant accused of fraud, against the plaintiff's own accountant, who, the defendant alleged, had negligently failed to warn the plaintiff of the dangers inherent in the defendant's transactions:\u000a
p718
aV It seems that although the matter is regarded by GOFF and JONES, The Law of Restitution, 4th Edition, 1993, at 329, as an open question or even subject to a prohibition on the enforcement of an illegal transaction, there has now been authority that a defence of \u000a
p719
aVdoes not run in a contribution claim under the Act: see K v. P 1993 Ch 140 at 148H/149B. Moreover, in Downs v. Chappell the court of appeal awarded contribution in favour of the fraudulent against the merely negligent. In any event, it does not seem to me that I am being asked to enforce an illegal transaction. \u000a
p720
aV The question arises: what is the credit to be allowed in respect of the Livingstone settlement? Dubal submitted that the credit should be regarded as no more than the sum which Mr Livingstone has been found to have received under the Richco scheme, namely $6,327,918. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Livingstone, however, that the whole of the sum of $15,540,000 paid under the Livingstone settlement ought to be regarded as credited to Dubal for the purpose of its present claim in these proceedings. This was a dispute worth some $9,000,000 about which I heard very little argument. In my judgment, the credit which has to be allowed is the full sum of $15,540,000. It is true that the claims in the Livingstone action embraced matters which went much wider than the payments made under the Richco consultancy agreement alone: it is possible therefore that some, most or even all of Dubal's recovery under the Livingstone settlement could have been properly allocated to claims other than Dubal's claim in these proceedings. The fact is, however, that no allocation was agreed in the Livingstone settlement. The Livingstone points of claim included (inter alia) a claim for the full sum lost by reason of payments under the Richco consultancy agreement in the sum there stated of $49,951,828. Although I may have overlooked it, I cannot even find a separate reference in that pleading to a receipts based claim in the sum of $6,327,918. Whereas Dubal's losses for the purposes of the present proceedings have been proved before me, the other claims included in the Livingstone proceedings have not been proved before me, and I have no particular insight into them. It seems to me that ultimately it is Dubal which bears the legal burden of proving its loss. If, therefore, it wishes to say that the $15,540,000 received from Mr Livingstone should not be credited to its present claim, but should be apportioned in some way across the whole gamut of the claims made in the Livingstone proceedings, then I think that Dubal bears that burden of proof. It has not even sought to discharge that burden. In the circumstances Dubal must give credit in these proceedings for the full amount of $15,540,000.\u000a
p721
aVThe only case against him is that, during the period covered by these transactions, he was in partnership as a solicitor with the other defendant. He took no part in them, and was ignorant of their nature. In my opinion, it is not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in such a business that he should so act as to make himself a constructive trustee, and thereby subject his partner to the same liability.\u000a
p722
aV Mr Salaam, Mr Livingstone and Mr Al Tajir submit otherwise. They submit that the argument of the Amhurst partners is novel and unsupported by authority. It would, if correct, enable all parties who were only vicariously liable, even in the typical case of vicarious liability for negligence, to present themselves as wholly without fault. Lister v. Romford Ice is not to the contrary, for there the employer had a cause of action in contract for an indemnity: the employee owed his employer a contractual duty of care. As against Mr Amhurst, therefore, the Amhurst partners might be entitled to a full indemnity, but not against Mr Salaam or the third parties. As against them the Amhurst partners must present themselves as wrongdoers standing in the shoes of Mr Amhurst: for it is only because they stand in his shoes that they are entitled to a contribution in the first place. That followed from a combination of the doctrine of vicarious liability itself, as a matter of construction of the Act since section 2(1) was dealing with responsibility for the damage in question for which the claimant was a person liable under section 1, and by reason of the doctrine of attribution whereby the knowledge and therefore dishonesty of Mr Amhurst was to be attributed to the Amhurst partners.\u000a
p723
aV I do not think that there is anything in the doctrines of vicarious liability or of attribution, or in the construction of the Act, to require a different answer. As between a plaintiff and an employer, the doctrine of vicarious liability requires a full recovery, based on concepts of agency and the policy considerations expressed in Holt CJ's dictum. As between persons liable for the same damage, however, between whom there is no cause of action other than a right of contribution under the Act, it does not seem to me to follow that the doctrine of vicarious liability necessarily operates in the same way. As for the doctrine of attribution, I do not think that that applies at all, other than in the sense of a reference under another name to the doctrine of vicarious liability: the Amhurst partners are not liable to Dubal because Mr Amhurst's assumed dishonesty is attributed personally to them, but only vicariously. In such circumstances it would be odd if his dishonesty had to be personally attributed to his partners for the first time at the stage of contribution. If that could happen at all, it could only be so because of the demands of the Act itself, creating a special rule of attribution: see Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v. Securities Commission \u000a
p724
aV Richco was not an originator, but it was a necessary part of the scheme, and was prepared to lend itself to the sham transactions, not only for the sake of its anticipated earnings under the scheme itself, at least 20% of the fee on sales, but also no doubt because it had other expectations of the alliance. Indeed, it was only willing to reduce its demands from 1.25% of the fee to at least 0.5% on the basis that the ASA would be put in place, out of the operation of which the beneficiaries under the subsidiary agreements could earn per tonne commissions. In any event, playing paymaster to the others was, as Mr Amhurst explained, the key to business with Dubal and in Dubai. \u000a
p725
aV Mr Al Tajir's evidence, however, was that he had ceased to be Director of the Ruler's Affairs in 1981, and thereafter had no formal role in the government of Dubai or in the administration of Dubal. His interest in Dubal thereafter was purely that of an interested and informed private businessman. The approach regarding an alliance with Richco had come from Mr Livingstone, who asked him to contact Marc Rich personally. Marc Rich was a neighbour in St Moritz and good friend. He did contact him, and agreed with Mr Rich that he would receive from Richco 1% of the value of the transaction, however it might be structured. Independently, Mr Livingstone had also approached Mr Salaam on the subject of the alliance: he explained this to Mr Al Tajir as being useful for the negotiation and implementation of the alliance. Mr Al Tajir asked Mr Livingstone to clear the matter with Sheikh Hamdan, one of the Ruler's sons and chairman of Dubal. He had no knowledge of the payments made to Mr Salaam or Mr Livingstone, or of any dishonesty, until he heard of Dubal's action against Mr Livingstone. He had not even realised that payments related to the Richco alliance had been arriving into the account of Al Tajir Limited. I was told that Mr Al Tajir had been intending to give evidence in person: at the last moment, however, he was unable to do so, for he was taken into hospital with chest pains, for examination and rest. I was provided with a letter from his cardiologist explaining the matter. In the circumstances, his witness statement was admitted as his evidence, but there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination.\u000a
p726
aV I have already found that Mr Al Tajir did resign from his position as Director of the Ruler's Office in 1981, as indeed he had stated in his witness statement. His evidence, which of course was not cross-examined, continued to the following effect. He said that he had become friends with Mr Livingstone and saw him from time to time as such, but that he had no further role after 1981 in the administration of Dubai. Sometime in 1986 his response to Mr Livingstone's telling him about his concerns for Dubal was that he should go to see his chairman, Sheikh Hamdan, about them. In 1987 in a similar conversation Mr Livingstone informed him that the management of Dubal had identified Richco as the company with which to form a strategic alliance to assist Dubal in its pressing problems. He was asked if he would assist Dubal in approaching Mr Rich, his good friend and neighbour in St Moritz, personally. He regarded Mr Livingstone as completely honest, and was delighted to be given the opportunity of involvement in so prestigious a project. He assumed that the matter had been discussed with Sheikh Hamdan and the latter's close confidant Mr Al Tayer, the minister of finance and industry. He therefore contacted Mr Rich initially by telephone and then in a meeting in St Moritz or Zug (Richco's headquarters). Mr Rich suggested that his people meet Mr Livingstone to discuss actual figures. It was agreed with Mr Rich that in the event of any deal he, Mr Al Tajir, would be looking for 1% of the value of the transaction. He reported all this back to Mr Livingstone. At about this time, Mr Salaam told him that he had also been approached by Mr Livingstone to assist him on a deal with Mr Rich. He did not tell Mr Salaam about his own involvement. He subsequently raised the question of Mr Salaam's role with Mr Livingstone, and was told that Mr Salaam was needed for his experience in transnational commercial transactions. He warned Mr Livingstone to check with Sheikh Hamdan, and was told that Mr Livingstone had already done so. He played no part in the implementation of arrangements with Richco. He was unaware of the subsidiary agreements. He had a further meeting with Mr Rich in late 1987 or early in 1988, and frequent meetings with Mr Strothotte in connection with mutual business relating to power engineering and infrastructure projects in the middle east, but he was never told of Mr Salaam's involvement in the Richco deal, nor of any payments to Mr Livingstone. As far as he had been aware, he had never himself received any payments deriving from the Richco deal, until Richco had itself disclosed such details.\u000a
p727
aV Mr Al Tajir did not seek to say that he possessed the authority of Dubal or the Ruler to give effect to the scheme. His evidence was rather that he played a purely facilitative role in bringing Dubal and Richco together, for which he had stipulated a fee by way of commission negotiated directly, and separately, with Marc Rich himself. He sought to distance himself from Mr Livingstone and Mr Salaam, and indeed from the whole transaction. He said he was unaware until a late date that any payments had been made into his (family) account at all.\u000a
p728
aV Mr Livingstone's case was similar to that of Mr Salaam, but more ambivalent. He regarded Mr Al Tajir as clothed with the authority of the Ruler of Dubai and liaised with him generally regarding Dubal's affairs as the Ruler's representative. It was he, Mr Livingstone, who identified the need for a commercial alliance between Dubal and Richco. With Mr Al Tajir's approval, Mr Salaam assisted him to negotiate that alliance, which was in the commercial interests of Dubal. The Richco consultancy agreement was part of a strategy and a package of transactions which embraced an Alumina Supply Agreement (the ASA), also dated 1 September 1987 and made with Richco's subsidiary Clarendon Limited, which was designed to safeguard Dubal's supplies of raw material, and in due course led in 1989 to a Pre-Sales Agreement, under which Richco advanced $250 million to Dubal against Dubal's forward sales of aluminium to Richco over the next five years. Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam required payment for their assistance in promoting the Richco alliance, and it was Mr Al Tajir who agreed the division of the income generated by the scheme between himself, Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone, and subsequently Mr Saad Salaam. He regarded his own share of the income not as something that he had stipulated for but as in the gift of Mr Al Tajir, and as reflecting the customary method in Dubai of rewarding good service. He was, however, ambivalent about the honesty of such payments. He had of course settled with Dubal even before these current proceedings were commenced, and had done so without serving a defence to Dubal's action against him. In his witness statement, which became his evidence in chief before me, he said this:\u000a
p729
aV Seventhly, in any event, it is reasonably plain that Mr Salaam did not even rely on Mr Al Tajir's authority in respect of all elements of Richco's payments under the subsidiary agreements. There is no evidence that Mr Al Tajir knew about the payment of the $2m mobilisation fee, or the monthly payments of $85,000. If he had done, he would have stipulated for his 40% share: for his evidence was that he had agreed with Mr Rich that he would get 40% of the value of the transaction.

It is true that Mr Salaam explained the curtailment of the JMS agreement from a minimum of ten years in its first version to only seven years in its second version as something that had been agreed with Mr Al Tajir at the outset.

aV case. Of course, in one sense it is necessary for the claimants to go further and require the respondents to appoint their arbitrator, but whether they have in fact made it clear that they are requiring the respondents to take some step themselves depends on what one can properly read into the message having regard to its terms and the context in which it was sent. Waltons' letter of 9th January 1997 was sent on the day before the one year time limit for commencing proceedings expired, and indeed it expressly referred to the expiry of time. The letter does not, of course, contain an express notice to the respondents requiring them to agree upon the appointment of a sole arbitrator or even to appoint their own arbitrator; insofar as it expressly required the respondents to do anything it was to acknowledge receipt and confirm that security would be provided. However, given its terms and the context in which it was sent I find it difficult to believe that the Club did not understand perfectly well what it was intended to convey. Indeed, when I asked Mr. Picken whether it could possibly be read otherwise than as a notice that the applicants were referring the dispute to arbitration and required the respondents to take appropriate action he was at something of a loss. In my view the letter gave clear notice to the Club on behalf of the respondents that the applicants were invoking the arbitration agreements in the bills of lading, that they had appointed their own arbitrator, and that they required the respondents to appoint their arbitrator so that the tribunal could be fully constituted and the proceedings got properly under way. If the arbitration agreement had provided simply for a three-man tribunal, therefore, I should have had little difficulty in holding that the notice, though undoubtedly poorly drafted, was adequate to satisfy the requirements of section 34(3) of the Limitation Act and thus sufficient to commence arbitration for the purposes of Article III, r.6.\u000a

Waltons' letter of 9th January 1997 was sent on the day before the one year time limit for commencing proceedings expired, and indeed it expressly referred to the expiry of time. The letter does not, of course, contain an express notice to the respondents requiring them to agree upon the appointment of a sole arbitrator or even to appoint their own arbitrator; insofar as it expressly required the respondents to do anything it was to acknowledge receipt and confirm that security would be provided. However, given its terms and the context in which it was sent I find it difficult to believe that the Club did not understand perfectly well what it was intended to convey. Indeed, when I asked Mr. Picken whether it could possibly be read otherwise than as a notice that the applicants were referring the dispute to arbitration and required the respondents to take appropriate action he was at something of a loss. In my view the letter gave clear notice to the Club on behalf of the respondents that the applicants were invoking the arbitration agreements in the bills of lading, that they had appointed their own arbitrator, and that they required the respondents to appoint their arbitrator so that the tribunal could be fully constituted and the proceedings got properly under way. If the arbitration agreement had provided simply for a three-man tribunal, therefore, I should have had little difficulty in holding that the notice, though undoubtedly poorly drafted, was adequate to satisfy the requirements of section 34(3) of the Limitation Act and thus sufficient to commence arbitration for the purposes of Article III, r.6.\u000a

aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a

aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim.

Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent.

aVThe existence of the BCS and Consolidator invoices came to light during the course of discovery in the arbitrations around the middle of 1993. In mid-1993 Royal Hotel announced that its directors had concluded that its 1993 accounts should include a prior year adjustment reversing the transactions with BCS, which Royal Hotel's expert accountant in the business interruption arbitration (Mr Haberman) told insurers' expert (Mr Lee) on 6th October 1993 that he suspected had been included in Royal Hotel's accounts to massage the figures, though neither he nor Mrs Farnon knew why. Mr Haberman's report dated 5th October 1993 said that he had ascertained by discussion with Mrs Farnon and Mr McHugh that the rooms charged to Consolidator were occupied by related company employees and represent actual occupancy, but determined to leave them out of consideration on the basis that they do not represent a source of repeat or recommended business as would conventional occupants. A distinction was thus being drawn between the BCS and Consolidator invoices.\u000a

p773
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p774
aVThis action is by way of sequel to \u000a
p775
aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a
p776
aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a
p777
aVThe present action raises issues of (A) materiality, (B) inducement, (C) affirmation and (D) cause of action or issue estoppel and/or abuse of process.  I take these in turn.\u000a
p778
aVRoyal Hotel's conduct in (1) to (5) related to poor trading performance, which could itself give a motive for extreme action to insurers' prejudice. Following a comment which I made at the outset of the trial, he supplemented his report with certain literature from the library of the Chartered Insurance Institute, in particular an extract from Hickmott on Interruption Insurance and two prize papers from a 1987 essay competition, Dr R. A. Litton's Moral Hazard and Insurance Fraud and A.E.B. Alport's Risk and Behaviour: some notes towards a definition of moral hazard.\u000a
p779
aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p780
aVIn his statement Mr Morris says that knowledge that inter-company transactions such as those represented by the Consolidator invoices existed and were fraudulent would have had a considerable impact on my attitude towards underwriting the policy, that it would have raised the question of moral hazard and, as a matter of policy, it would have caused me to discuss the matter with Mr Peter Walpole with a view to agreeing an appropriate course of action. Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent. I bear in mind that he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Walpole considered however that\u000a
p781
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p782
aVThe principles governing affirmation (or election) were considered in my previous judgment at p. 126. My conclusions in the context of that action appear at pp. 132-3. In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it. Provided that the party knows sufficient of the facts to know that he has that right, it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of those facts. Although this point was left open in \u000a

aVThe existence of the BCS and Consolidator invoices came to light during the course of discovery in the arbitrations around the middle of 1993. In mid-1993 Royal Hotel announced that its directors had concluded that its 1993 accounts should include a prior year adjustment reversing the transactions with BCS, which Royal Hotel's expert accountant in the business interruption arbitration (Mr Haberman) told insurers' expert (Mr Lee) on 6th October 1993 that he suspected had been included in Royal Hotel's accounts to massage the figures, though neither he nor Mrs Farnon knew why.

A distinction was thus being drawn between the BCS and Consolidator invoices.\u000a

aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it.

aVOn 25th March 1994 Sir Patrick Neill Q.C. issued his first interim award in the material damage arbitration. Insurers' application for leave to appeal was dismissed by Longmore J. on 10th June 1994. Insurers then made a payment to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage award on 21st June 1994, obtaining an order on 28th July 1994 that involved payment of 950,000 into a joint account pending trial of the 1994 action. Royal Hotel's solicitors sought from Sir Patrick a second interim award for costs of the material damage arbitration, which they submitted should follow the event. After letters from them and Sir Patrick, Herbert Smith responded on 12th October 1994:\u000a
p788
aVIn the 1994 action, points of reply and defence to counterclaim were served on 29th April 1994 and a request was made on 14th June 1994 for particulars of the allegations in the points of defence regarding contractors and accommodation and as to how the 150,000 was calculated to support the allegation that it was a reasonable sum for such accommodation.\u000a
p789
aVDuring a meeting to discuss these particulars within Herbert Smith, Mr Bakes noted on his copy of this page of the particulars the words Moral hazard and Rel'ship with Banks. On about 22nd May 1995 witness statements by Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil were served in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh's statement confirmed that the contractors' workmen had been housed in staff accommodation (Ypres Guest House, Kingslynn and Fermoy) and other guest houses, and not therefore in the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices. The statement recounted that in mid-1991 the hotel had cash flow difficulties and was supported by Consolidator in a variety of ways, and went on:\u000a
p790
aVOn 7th November 1995 Royal Hotel's solicitors sent Herbert Smith a detailed summary of costs and disbursements in the material damage arbitration seeking to reach agreement without need for taxation. On 22nd November 1995 Herbert Smith requested copy invoices relating to experts' and counsels' fees and other matters to enable them to consider the disbursements claimed in more detail, and these were then sent. After further pressure from Royal Hotel's solicitors to agree costs with a 10% discount against the sums claimed (failing which such solicitors threatened an application to vary the order relating to the 950,000), Herbert Smith wrote on 22nd December 1995 that they were seeking instructions and that Royal Hotel's time limit of 29th December 1995 was unreasonable, and again on 22nd December, after taking instructions, that Royal Hotel's offer was unacceptable. A letter from Herbert Smith to Royal Insurance of the same date recorded that the thinking behind this was, first, that insurers had good prospects of a better discount on taxation, secondly, that agreement on costs might simply provide Royal Hotel with a fighting fund for the impending trial of the fraud (i.e. 1994) action and, thirdly, that\u000a

aVIn November/December 1995 Mr Bakes with assistance from counsel prepared a draft amended statement of claim, which was served in January 1996 pursuant to leave granted on 13th December 1995. It added to the existing allegations, that the BCS and Consolidator transactions represented fictitious transactions, further allegations that they were\u000a

The Plaintiffs will say that such occupancy as there may have been by workmen employed for the benefit of the Defendants or either of them (as to which no admissions are made) was not occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel.\u000a
p795
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a

aVThe trial of the 1994 action began on 7th February 1996. Judgment on claim and counterclaim were given on 5th July 1996 to the effect summarized at the start of this judgment. In the light of my judgment, insurers and Herbert Smith took independent expert advice on materiality, discussed materiality, inducement and the prospects of Royal Hotel establishing affirmation, decided to avoid the material damage insurance and on 12th August 1996 wrote accordingly.\u000a
p797
aVHerbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims, as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters. The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence, in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance. Royal Insurance, which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI, thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and, as Mr Carter confirmed, to make judgments that required to be made during their course. Before me, Herbert Smith's state of mind and handling of both the arbitrations and the 1994 action have been treated for all purposes as synonymous with insurers'. No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance. This is relevant, since Herbert Smith at some points conducted matters without specific reference back to insurers.\u000a
p798
aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a
p799
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a
p800
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p801
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p802
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p803
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p804
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a
p805
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p806
aVthere was a sense that actually as a matter of efficiently conducting this matter we should dispose of the fraud action because otherwise there would be a sense of wasting the court's time with lots of pleading and so on and lengthening the original trial.\u000a
p807
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p808
aVWe decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy.\u000a
p809
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p810
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p811
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p812
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a
p813
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p814
aVRoyal Hotel's case is that there were unequivocal acts by insurers as follows: (1) payment of sums under the material damage policy in June 1994; (2) conduct in treating the policy and/or awards under it as valid and enforceable, consisting in particular of (i) the prosecution of the 1994 action and defence to the counterclaim in it, (ii) the sequence of events leading to the second interim award under the material damage policy and (iii) the subsequent correspondence between parties with a view to agreeing the costs due under that award. Royal Hotel now seeks to add (iv) the consent order dated 24th July 1996 in the 1994 action, pursuant to which the balance of the material damage award was paid by insurers.\u000a
p815
aVAs to (2), the original counterclaim in the 1994 action was for conspiracy in respect of both policies, with breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy appearing as a particular of conspiracy. The damage alleged consisted of loss suffered by delay due to the conspiracy in expeditious payment of claims under both policies. It would have been an answer to a claim for such damages (although, it may well be, not to the allegation of conspiracy itself) that the material damage policy had been avoided. The defence to counterclaim served 29th April 1994 pleaded:\u000a
p816
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a
p817
aV 1969 2 Q.B. 507, (where it did not matter whether the agreement was void or voidable and the majority judgments are open to different interpretations). I am inclined to think that the agreement to make the interim payment would have fallen away automatically with avoidance of the material damage policy. On this limited basis and more generally because the 1994 action was, to outward appearances, conducted throughout in terms which assumed the existence and validity of the material damage policy, it seems to me that, whatever was intended, insurers' conduct of the 1994 action is also capable of constituting an unequivocal representation as to the validity of the material damage policy.\u000a
p818
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p819
aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a
p820
aVfollows that insurers' action fails on the ground that insurers affirmed the material damage policy, despite their and legal advisers' unannounced internal intention not to do so.\u000a
p821
aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all. They are, she submitted precluded on grounds of estoppel or abuse of process from doing so subsequently. This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

p823
aVThe relevant parties before me were parties to the 1994 litigation. The judgment in that action is final and conclusive on the merits of the matters decided. But the validity of the material damage policy was not in issue in the 1994 action. The first head of jurisdiction identified in the authorities, \u000a
p824
aVin the narrow sense, is not available. The wider head of jurisdiction requires consideration whether insurers could and should have put the voidability of the material damage policy in issue in the 1994 action, and should be held precluded from doing so in the present fresh action.\u000a

aV can only apply when there has been a decision in the prior proceedings adverse to the party now seeking to pursue further litigation: see The Doctrine of Res Judicata by Spencer Bower (2nd Ed., 1969) paragraphs 197 and 203. This qualification inter-relates with the rule, mentioned in Chitty paragraph 25-010, that cause of action and issue estoppel only apply to issues which it was necessary to determine for the purpose of resolving the previous proceedings. Issues which a court may in passing have decided or assumed against a party but in respect of which he could not \u000a

aV 1990 1 A.C. 723, 752, Balcombe L.J. expressed the view that appealability on the particular issue was no more than a test to decide whether a particular issue was fundamental to the court's substantive decision. These points were not argued before me, and I do no more than draw attention to them. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that my judgment in the 1994 action was adverse to insurers on the issue whether ICCI was in breach of the contract to pay 1 million under the material damage policy and in adjudicating that ICCI was liable to pay damages to be assessed for that breach. That conclusion could not have been reached unless the material damage policy continued in force.\u000a
p829
aVThe other objection is that it is erroneous to treat an issue about avoidance which could only arise as and when insurers chose to avoid, as a defence or as an issue which could or should have been raised in the 1994 action at all. No such issue arose \u000a

Previously, in mid-1995, JMB had demanded payment from the same companies of various other monies due from them as principal debtors or as guarantors of companies other than Gomba Exim Ltd., and judgments were given against such companies in respect of those monies on 16th January 1996. It was argued in the 1991 action that JMB was precluded under the wider principle in \u000a

aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a

aV, even if it were otherwise applicable, to apply it to a case where no cause of action existed at the relevant date but which might then have existed had JMB made the necessary demands on the plaintiffs.\u000a
p833
aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p834
aV presents an instructive contrast. In the first action (no.969), the appellant, Yat Tung, had claimed that an apparent mortgage to secure a loan to it was a sham and that it held the property as trustee for the bank, Dao Heng. Dao Heng counterclaimed for loss suffered by it on exercise by it of a power of sale contained in the mortgage, by virtue of which it sold the property to Choi Kee. In response to the counterclaim Yat Tung admitted the sale to Choi Kee, but denied that it owed any sum or that the bank had suffered any loss. Yat Tung lost both the claim and the counterclaim. In the second action (no.534), Yat Tung claimed against both the bank and Choi Kee that the sale was void or voidable as fraudulent in that both had, in effect, been conspiring to obtain the property at a gross undervalue. The issue was whether the allegation of fraud and voidability of the sale to Choi Kee were matters available for litigation in action no. 969: see page 5S8D. I observe, in parenthesis, that this formulation reflects what I would perceive to have been the position in law, namely that, if Yat Tung's allegations were well founded, they would have made the sale voidable, not void. The rules would have enabled such an issue to be raised by counterclaim to the counterclaim. That being so, the Privy Council applied \u000a
p835
aVThis authority appears therefore to favour the view that there may be circumstances, in which a party who fails to take advantage of a right to avoid (of which he knew or ought to have known) in order to defeat a claim under or by reference to a contract, may be precluded from later doing so. Such an avoidance may be effected in and by the same pleading that raises it as an issue in the action. Although in a strict sense, a party has no defence unless and until he avoids, there is an element of unreality about this view of the matter. As responses to a claim, avoidance, breach of warranty, failure to perform a condition precedent to liability or a suggestion of fraudulent claim are in the ordinary course all probably considered and, where arguable, either deployed or rejected in litigation, without attention to whether they depend on some formal act which has effect in contract or equity outside insurers' pleading. Avoidance for non-disclosure does depend on such an act. Avoidance for breach of warranty now, on House of Lords authority, \u000a
p836
aV into the field of exercise of substantive rights. Such an extension in the particular context of voidability of insurance contracts appears to me to reflect the commercial and practical realities which apply between parties to litigation such as the 1994 action, where the insurance contracts had no continuing significance save in respect of claims already paid or being pursued under them. I note, in passing, that in \u000a
p837
aV. Lord Denning, who regarded the compromise agreement as voidable not void, nonetheless spoke of Mr Magee as having no no valid claim on the insurance policy (page 515A). That usage reflects the same reality. Apart from the claims which had been paid or were being pursued in respect of the material damage insurance policy, that policy had by the time of the 1994 action no significance for either party.\u000a
p838
aVIn my judgment, the principle extended in this way in potentially applicable in the present context. Reliance was placed on the material damage policy in the counterclaims made by Royal Hotel against insurers in the 1994 action. Insurers met that reliance by accepting the existence of the material damage policy, but by denying any liability, whether for conspiracy or for breach, in respect of it. In one area, albeit minor, insurers lost on the case made against them of breach. The effect of their present case would be to undermine that conclusion, as well as to enable them to recover the sums paid under the material damage policy, which they could on the face of it also have counterclaimed to the counterclaim in the 1994 action. How the 1994 action would then have proceeded is a matter which cannot of course now be known for certain; but it would probably have been considered on the application for a split trial with which I in fact dealt with on 9th December 1994, as outlined on page 98 of my previous judgment, or at a later stage if the issue had been raised later.\u000a
p839
aVThere would in practice probably also have been a claim to avoid the business interruption policy. The strong likelihood is that the issue of avoidance for non-disclosure, being relatively short and linked factually with the background issues in the 1994 action as well as the counterclaim, would have been tried and determined with all the other issues which I decided on 5th July 1996.\u000a
p840
aVThere is in the circumstances no doubt that the issue of non-disclosure and avoidance could with reasonable diligence have been brought forward in the 1994 action. Was it one which properly belonged to the previous action? And, if it did, are there special circumstances which should lead to the non-application of the wider rule in \u000a
p841
aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy. Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in \u000a
p842
aVsee this as a case where special circumstances exist taking the matter outside the scope of that principle.  The court need not be too sympathetic to a tactical decision to postpone avoidance, in circumstances where, to all outward appearances and so far as the court was aware, the validity of the material damage policy was and remained throughout the course of the 1994 action unchallenged - as Mr Bakes, on the basis of his attendance note dated 23rd July 1996, also believed that Royal Hotel itself thought was the case.\u000a
p843
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a
p844
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p845
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p846
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p847
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p848
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p849
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a
p850
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p851
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a
p852
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p853
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel.

p854
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a

aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a

aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action.

p858
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p859
aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all. They are, she submitted precluded on grounds of estoppel or abuse of process from doing so subsequently. This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a

aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a
p862
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p863
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p864
aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p865
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates.

aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p867
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p868
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a

p871
aVThe principles governing affirmation (or election) were considered in my previous judgment at p. 126. My conclusions in the context of that action appear at pp. 132-3. In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it. Provided that the party knows sufficient of the facts to know that he has that right, it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of those facts. Although this point was left open in \u000a

aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a
p873
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a

aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one.

We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p876
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p877
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p878
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a
p879
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p880
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p881
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996.

p882
aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a

aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a
p884
aVIn my judgment, the principle extended in this way in potentially applicable in the present context. Reliance was placed on the material damage policy in the counterclaims made by Royal Hotel against insurers in the 1994 action. Insurers met that reliance by accepting the existence of the material damage policy, but by denying any liability, whether for conspiracy or for breach, in respect of it. In one area, albeit minor, insurers lost on the case made against them of breach. The effect of their present case would be to undermine that conclusion, as well as to enable them to recover the sums paid under the material damage policy, which they could on the face of it also have counterclaimed to the counterclaim in the 1994 action. How the 1994 action would then have proceeded is a matter which cannot of course now be known for certain; but it would probably have been considered on the application for a split trial with which I in fact dealt with on 9th December 1994, as outlined on page 98 of my previous judgment, or at a later stage if the issue had been raised later.\u000a
p885
aVThere would in practice probably also have been a claim to avoid the business interruption policy. The strong likelihood is that the issue of avoidance for non-disclosure, being relatively short and linked factually with the background issues in the 1994 action as well as the counterclaim, would have been tried and determined with all the other issues which I decided on 5th July 1996.\u000a

aVThis action is by way of sequel to \u000a
p887
aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a

aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a

aVRoyal Hotel's conduct in (1) to (5) related to poor trading performance, which could itself give a motive for extreme action to insurers' prejudice. Following a comment which I made at the outset of the trial, he supplemented his report with certain literature from the library of the Chartered Insurance Institute, in particular an extract from Hickmott on Interruption Insurance and two prize papers from a 1987 essay competition, Dr R. A. Litton's Moral Hazard and Insurance Fraud and A.E.B. Alport's Risk and Behaviour: some notes towards a definition of moral hazard.\u000a
p891
aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p892
aVIn his statement Mr Morris says that knowledge that inter-company transactions such as those represented by the Consolidator invoices existed and were fraudulent would have had a considerable impact on my attitude towards underwriting the policy, that it would have raised the question of moral hazard and, as a matter of policy, it would have caused me to discuss the matter with Mr Peter Walpole with a view to agreeing an appropriate course of action. Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent. I bear in mind that he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Walpole considered however that\u000a
p893
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p894
aVThe principles governing affirmation (or election) were considered in my previous judgment at p. 126. My conclusions in the context of that action appear at pp. 132-3. In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it. Provided that the party knows sufficient of the facts to know that he has that right, it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of those facts. Although this point was left open in \u000a

aVThe existence of the BCS and Consolidator invoices came to light during the course of discovery in the arbitrations around the middle of 1993. In mid-1993 Royal Hotel announced that its directors had concluded that its 1993 accounts should include a prior year adjustment reversing the transactions with BCS, which Royal Hotel's expert accountant in the business interruption arbitration (Mr Haberman) told insurers' expert (Mr Lee) on 6th October 1993 that he suspected had been included in Royal Hotel's accounts to massage the figures, though neither he nor Mrs Farnon knew why. Mr Haberman's report dated 5th October 1993 said that he had ascertained by discussion with Mrs Farnon and Mr McHugh that the rooms charged to Consolidator were occupied by related company employees and represent actual occupancy, but determined to leave them out of consideration on the basis that they do not represent a source of repeat or recommended business as would conventional occupants. A distinction was thus being drawn between the BCS and Consolidator invoices.\u000a
p896
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a

aVThe previous action (the 1994 action) was begun on 24th January 1994. The statement of claim endorsed on the writ asserted that the statistics supplied to Cunningham Hart by Royal Hotel's letter dated 19th August 1992\u000a

aVwere knowingly false and misleading in that they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions. The Consolidator invoices are similar in all material respects to the BCS documentation and represent fictitious transactions.\u000a
p899
aVOn 25th March 1994 Sir Patrick Neill Q.C. issued his first interim award in the material damage arbitration. Insurers' application for leave to appeal was dismissed by Longmore J. on 10th June 1994. Insurers then made a payment to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage award on 21st June 1994, obtaining an order on 28th July 1994 that involved payment of 950,000 into a joint account pending trial of the 1994 action. Royal Hotel's solicitors sought from Sir Patrick a second interim award for costs of the material damage arbitration, which they submitted should follow the event. After letters from them and Sir Patrick, Herbert Smith responded on 12th October 1994:\u000a
p900
aVIn the 1994 action, points of reply and defence to counterclaim were served on 29th April 1994 and a request was made on 14th June 1994 for particulars of the allegations in the points of defence regarding contractors and accommodation and as to how the 150,000 was calculated to support the allegation that it was a reasonable sum for such accommodation.\u000a
p901
aVDuring a meeting to discuss these particulars within Herbert Smith, Mr Bakes noted on his copy of this page of the particulars the words Moral hazard and Rel'ship with Banks. On about 22nd May 1995 witness statements by Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil were served in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh's statement confirmed that the contractors' workmen had been housed in staff accommodation (Ypres Guest House, Kingslynn and Fermoy) and other guest houses, and not therefore in the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices. The statement recounted that in mid-1991 the hotel had cash flow difficulties and was supported by Consolidator in a variety of ways, and went on:\u000a
p902
aVOn 7th November 1995 Royal Hotel's solicitors sent Herbert Smith a detailed summary of costs and disbursements in the material damage arbitration seeking to reach agreement without need for taxation. On 22nd November 1995 Herbert Smith requested copy invoices relating to experts' and counsels' fees and other matters to enable them to consider the disbursements claimed in more detail, and these were then sent. After further pressure from Royal Hotel's solicitors to agree costs with a 10% discount against the sums claimed (failing which such solicitors threatened an application to vary the order relating to the 950,000), Herbert Smith wrote on 22nd December 1995 that they were seeking instructions and that Royal Hotel's time limit of 29th December 1995 was unreasonable, and again on 22nd December, after taking instructions, that Royal Hotel's offer was unacceptable. A letter from Herbert Smith to Royal Insurance of the same date recorded that the thinking behind this was, first, that insurers had good prospects of a better discount on taxation, secondly, that agreement on costs might simply provide Royal Hotel with a fighting fund for the impending trial of the fraud (i.e. 1994) action and, thirdly, that\u000a

aVIn November/December 1995 Mr Bakes with assistance from counsel prepared a draft amended statement of claim, which was served in January 1996 pursuant to leave granted on 13th December 1995. It added to the existing allegations, that the BCS and Consolidator transactions represented fictitious transactions, further allegations that they were\u000a

aV(b) they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions, which in whole or in part did not represent any or any real occupancy of the hotel and/or did not represent occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel. The Plaintiffs will say that such occupancy as there may have been by workmen employed for the benefit of the Defendants or either of them (as to which no admissions are made) was not occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel.\u000a
p907
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a

aVThe trial of the 1994 action began on 7th February 1996. Judgment on claim and counterclaim were given on 5th July 1996 to the effect summarized at the start of this judgment. In the light of my judgment, insurers and Herbert Smith took independent expert advice on materiality, discussed materiality, inducement and the prospects of Royal Hotel establishing affirmation, decided to avoid the material damage insurance and on 12th August 1996 wrote accordingly.\u000a
p909
aVHerbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims, as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters. The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence, in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance. Royal Insurance, which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI, thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and, as Mr Carter confirmed, to make judgments that required to be made during their course. Before me, Herbert Smith's state of mind and handling of both the arbitrations and the 1994 action have been treated for all purposes as synonymous with insurers'. No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance. This is relevant, since Herbert Smith at some points conducted matters without specific reference back to insurers.\u000a
p910
aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a
p911
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a
p912
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p913
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p914
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p915
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p916
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a
p917
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p918
aVthere was a sense that actually as a matter of efficiently conducting this matter we should dispose of the fraud action because otherwise there would be a sense of wasting the court's time with lots of pleading and so on and lengthening the original trial.\u000a
p919
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p920
aVWe decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy.\u000a
p921
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p922
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p923
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p924
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a
p925
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p926
aVRoyal Hotel's case is that there were unequivocal acts by insurers as follows: (1) payment of sums under the material damage policy in June 1994; (2) conduct in treating the policy and/or awards under it as valid and enforceable, consisting in particular of (i) the prosecution of the 1994 action and defence to the counterclaim in it, (ii) the sequence of events leading to the second interim award under the material damage policy and (iii) the subsequent correspondence between parties with a view to agreeing the costs due under that award. Royal Hotel now seeks to add (iv) the consent order dated 24th July 1996 in the 1994 action, pursuant to which the balance of the material damage award was paid by insurers.\u000a
p927
aVAs to (2), the original counterclaim in the 1994 action was for conspiracy in respect of both policies, with breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy appearing as a particular of conspiracy. The damage alleged consisted of loss suffered by delay due to the conspiracy in expeditious payment of claims under both policies. It would have been an answer to a claim for such damages (although, it may well be, not to the allegation of conspiracy itself) that the material damage policy had been avoided. The defence to counterclaim served 29th April 1994 pleaded:\u000a
p928
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a
p929
aV 1969 2 Q.B. 507, (where it did not matter whether the agreement was void or voidable and the majority judgments are open to different interpretations). I am inclined to think that the agreement to make the interim payment would have fallen away automatically with avoidance of the material damage policy. On this limited basis and more generally because the 1994 action was, to outward appearances, conducted throughout in terms which assumed the existence and validity of the material damage policy, it seems to me that, whatever was intended, insurers' conduct of the 1994 action is also capable of constituting an unequivocal representation as to the validity of the material damage policy.\u000a
p930
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p931
aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a
p932
aVfollows that insurers' action fails on the ground that insurers affirmed the material damage policy, despite their and legal advisers' unannounced internal intention not to do so.\u000a
p933
aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all. They are, she submitted precluded on grounds of estoppel or abuse of process from doing so subsequently. This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

aV under the rubric of cause of action or issue estoppel, but identifying with reference to this and other authorities a third head of jurisdiction under the rules of court and inherent jurisdiction, to stay or dismiss an action by which a plaintiff seeks to raise matters which were or should have been litigated in earlier proceedings. It seems to me, in the light of \u000a
p935
aVThe relevant parties before me were parties to the 1994 litigation. The judgment in that action is final and conclusive on the merits of the matters decided. But the validity of the material damage policy was not in issue in the 1994 action. The first head of jurisdiction identified in the authorities, \u000a
p936
aVin the narrow sense, is not available. The wider head of jurisdiction requires consideration whether insurers could and should have put the voidability of the material damage policy in issue in the 1994 action, and should be held precluded from doing so in the present fresh action.\u000a
p937
aV can only apply when there has been a decision in the prior proceedings adverse to the party now seeking to pursue further litigation: see The Doctrine of Res Judicata by Spencer Bower (2nd Ed., 1969) paragraphs 197 and 203. This qualification inter-relates with the rule, mentioned in Chitty paragraph 25-010, that cause of action and issue estoppel only apply to issues which it was necessary to determine for the purpose of resolving the previous proceedings. Issues which a court may in passing have decided or assumed against a party but in respect of which he could not \u000a
p938
aVappeal (either because he succeeded in the action on other grounds or because he would have lost anyway on other grounds) are likely on this basis to fall outside \u000a
p939
aV, The requirement of an adverse decision, on the particular issue and on the action as a whole, cannot however be absolute. For example, under the narrower principle in \u000a
p940
aV 1990 1 A.C. 723, 752, Balcombe L.J. expressed the view that appealability on the particular issue was no more than a test to decide whether a particular issue was fundamental to the court's substantive decision. These points were not argued before me, and I do no more than draw attention to them. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that my judgment in the 1994 action was adverse to insurers on the issue whether ICCI was in breach of the contract to pay 1 million under the material damage policy and in adjudicating that ICCI was liable to pay damages to be assessed for that breach. That conclusion could not have been reached unless the material damage policy continued in force.\u000a
p941
aVThe other objection is that it is erroneous to treat an issue about avoidance which could only arise as and when insurers chose to avoid, as a defence or as an issue which could or should have been raised in the 1994 action at all. No such issue arose \u000a
p942
aV (9th December 1993. In that case Minories Finance Ltd. (formerly Johnson Mathey Bankers Ltd. - JMB) claimed by writ issued in October 1991 in respect of monies of which they had on 25th February 1996 demanded payment from various companies in the Gomba group as guarantors of Gomba Exim Ltd. Previously, in mid-1995, JMB had demanded payment from the same companies of various other monies due from them as principal debtors or as guarantors of companies other than Gomba Exim Ltd., and judgments were given against such companies in respect of those monies on 16th January 1996. It was argued in the 1991 action that JMB was precluded under the wider principle in \u000a
p943
aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a
p944
aV, even if it were otherwise applicable, to apply it to a case where no cause of action existed at the relevant date but which might then have existed had JMB made the necessary demands on the plaintiffs.\u000a
p945
aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p946
aV presents an instructive contrast. In the first action (no.969), the appellant, Yat Tung, had claimed that an apparent mortgage to secure a loan to it was a sham and that it held the property as trustee for the bank, Dao Heng. Dao Heng counterclaimed for loss suffered by it on exercise by it of a power of sale contained in the mortgage, by virtue of which it sold the property to Choi Kee. In response to the counterclaim Yat Tung admitted the sale to Choi Kee, but denied that it owed any sum or that the bank had suffered any loss. Yat Tung lost both the claim and the counterclaim. In the second action (no.534), Yat Tung claimed against both the bank and Choi Kee that the sale was void or voidable as fraudulent in that both had, in effect, been conspiring to obtain the property at a gross undervalue. The issue was whether the allegation of fraud and voidability of the sale to Choi Kee were matters available for litigation in action no. 969: see page 5S8D. I observe, in parenthesis, that this formulation reflects what I would perceive to have been the position in law, namely that, if Yat Tung's allegations were well founded, they would have made the sale voidable, not void. The rules would have enabled such an issue to be raised by counterclaim to the counterclaim. That being so, the Privy Council applied \u000a
p947
aVThis authority appears therefore to favour the view that there may be circumstances, in which a party who fails to take advantage of a right to avoid (of which he knew or ought to have known) in order to defeat a claim under or by reference to a contract, may be precluded from later doing so. Such an avoidance may be effected in and by the same pleading that raises it as an issue in the action. Although in a strict sense, a party has no defence unless and until he avoids, there is an element of unreality about this view of the matter. As responses to a claim, avoidance, breach of warranty, failure to perform a condition precedent to liability or a suggestion of fraudulent claim are in the ordinary course all probably considered and, where arguable, either deployed or rejected in litigation, without attention to whether they depend on some formal act which has effect in contract or equity outside insurers' pleading. Avoidance for non-disclosure does depend on such an act. Avoidance for breach of warranty now, on House of Lords authority, \u000a
p948
aV into the field of exercise of substantive rights. Such an extension in the particular context of voidability of insurance contracts appears to me to reflect the commercial and practical realities which apply between parties to litigation such as the 1994 action, where the insurance contracts had no continuing significance save in respect of claims already paid or being pursued under them. I note, in passing, that in \u000a
p949
aV. Lord Denning, who regarded the compromise agreement as voidable not void, nonetheless spoke of Mr Magee as having no no valid claim on the insurance policy (page 515A). That usage reflects the same reality. Apart from the claims which had been paid or were being pursued in respect of the material damage insurance policy, that policy had by the time of the 1994 action no significance for either party.\u000a
p950
aVIn my judgment, the principle extended in this way in potentially applicable in the present context. Reliance was placed on the material damage policy in the counterclaims made by Royal Hotel against insurers in the 1994 action. Insurers met that reliance by accepting the existence of the material damage policy, but by denying any liability, whether for conspiracy or for breach, in respect of it. In one area, albeit minor, insurers lost on the case made against them of breach. The effect of their present case would be to undermine that conclusion, as well as to enable them to recover the sums paid under the material damage policy, which they could on the face of it also have counterclaimed to the counterclaim in the 1994 action. How the 1994 action would then have proceeded is a matter which cannot of course now be known for certain; but it would probably have been considered on the application for a split trial with which I in fact dealt with on 9th December 1994, as outlined on page 98 of my previous judgment, or at a later stage if the issue had been raised later.\u000a
p951
aVThere would in practice probably also have been a claim to avoid the business interruption policy. The strong likelihood is that the issue of avoidance for non-disclosure, being relatively short and linked factually with the background issues in the 1994 action as well as the counterclaim, would have been tried and determined with all the other issues which I decided on 5th July 1996.\u000a
p952
aVThere is in the circumstances no doubt that the issue of non-disclosure and avoidance could with reasonable diligence have been brought forward in the 1994 action. Was it one which properly belonged to the previous action? And, if it did, are there special circumstances which should lead to the non-application of the wider rule in \u000a
p953
aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy. Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in \u000a
p954
aVsee this as a case where special circumstances exist taking the matter outside the scope of that principle.  The court need not be too sympathetic to a tactical decision to postpone avoidance, in circumstances where, to all outward appearances and so far as the court was aware, the validity of the material damage policy was and remained throughout the course of the 1994 action unchallenged - as Mr Bakes, on the basis of his attendance note dated 23rd July 1996, also believed that Royal Hotel itself thought was the case.\u000a
p955
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p956
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a
p957
aVThe previous action (the 1994 action) was begun on 24th January 1994. The statement of claim endorsed on the writ asserted that the statistics supplied to Cunningham Hart by Royal Hotel's letter dated 19th August 1992\u000a
p958
aVHerbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims, as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters. The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence, in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance. Royal Insurance, which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI, thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and, as Mr Carter confirmed, to make judgments that required to be made during their course. Before me, Herbert Smith's state of mind and handling of both the arbitrations and the 1994 action have been treated for all purposes as synonymous with insurers'. No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance. This is relevant, since Herbert Smith at some points conducted matters without specific reference back to insurers.\u000a
p959
aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a
p960
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a
p961
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a
p962
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p963
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p964
aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a

It seems to me, in the light of \u000a
p966
aV presents an instructive contrast. In the first action (no.969), the appellant, Yat Tung, had claimed that an apparent mortgage to secure a loan to it was a sham and that it held the property as trustee for the bank, Dao Heng. Dao Heng counterclaimed for loss suffered by it on exercise by it of a power of sale contained in the mortgage, by virtue of which it sold the property to Choi Kee. In response to the counterclaim Yat Tung admitted the sale to Choi Kee, but denied that it owed any sum or that the bank had suffered any loss. Yat Tung lost both the claim and the counterclaim. In the second action (no.534), Yat Tung claimed against both the bank and Choi Kee that the sale was void or voidable as fraudulent in that both had, in effect, been conspiring to obtain the property at a gross undervalue. The issue was whether the allegation of fraud and voidability of the sale to Choi Kee were matters available for litigation in action no. 969: see page 5S8D. I observe, in parenthesis, that this formulation reflects what I would perceive to have been the position in law, namely that, if Yat Tung's allegations were well founded, they would have made the sale voidable, not void. The rules would have enabled such an issue to be raised by counterclaim to the counterclaim. That being so, the Privy Council applied \u000a
p967
aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy. Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in \u000a
p968
aVsee this as a case where special circumstances exist taking the matter outside the scope of that principle.  The court need not be too sympathetic to a tactical decision to postpone avoidance, in circumstances where, to all outward appearances and so far as the court was aware, the validity of the material damage policy was and remained throughout the course of the 1994 action unchallenged - as Mr Bakes, on the basis of his attendance note dated 23rd July 1996, also believed that Royal Hotel itself thought was the case.\u000a
p969
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a
p970
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p971
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p972
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p973
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p974
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p975
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a
p976
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p977
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a
p978
aVwere knowingly false and misleading in that they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions. The Consolidator invoices are similar in all material respects to the BCS documentation and represent fictitious transactions.\u000a
p979
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p980
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p981
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p982
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a

aV. Lord Denning, who regarded the compromise agreement as voidable not void, nonetheless spoke of Mr Magee as having no no valid claim on the insurance policy (page 515A).

aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a

Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal.

p989
aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a

aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p991
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p992
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p993
aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a

aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p995
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a

p998
aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a
p999
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a
p1000
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p1001
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p1002
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a

p1004
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a

aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aVIn the 1994 action, points of reply and defence to counterclaim were served on 29th April 1994 and a request was made on 14th June 1994 for particulars of the allegations in the points of defence regarding contractors and accommodation and as to how the 150,000 was calculated to support the allegation that it was a reasonable sum for such accommodation.\u000a
p1009
aVOn 7th November 1995 Royal Hotel's solicitors sent Herbert Smith a detailed summary of costs and disbursements in the material damage arbitration seeking to reach agreement without need for taxation. On 22nd November 1995 Herbert Smith requested copy invoices relating to experts' and counsels' fees and other matters to enable them to consider the disbursements claimed in more detail, and these were then sent. After further pressure from Royal Hotel's solicitors to agree costs with a 10% discount against the sums claimed (failing which such solicitors threatened an application to vary the order relating to the 950,000), Herbert Smith wrote on 22nd December 1995 that they were seeking instructions and that Royal Hotel's time limit of 29th December 1995 was unreasonable, and again on 22nd December, after taking instructions, that Royal Hotel's offer was unacceptable. A letter from Herbert Smith to Royal Insurance of the same date recorded that the thinking behind this was, first, that insurers had good prospects of a better discount on taxation, secondly, that agreement on costs might simply provide Royal Hotel with a fighting fund for the impending trial of the fraud (i.e. 1994) action and, thirdly, that\u000a

A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a

aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a

Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent. I bear in mind that he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Walpole considered however that\u000a
p1017
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1018
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a
p1019
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p1020
aVthere was a sense that actually as a matter of efficiently conducting this matter we should dispose of the fraud action because otherwise there would be a sense of wasting the court's time with lots of pleading and so on and lengthening the original trial.\u000a
p1021
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p1022
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p1023
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a

aV 1969 2 Q.B. 507, (where it did not matter whether the agreement was void or voidable and the majority judgments are open to different interpretations). I am inclined to think that the agreement to make the interim payment would have fallen away automatically with avoidance of the material damage policy. On this limited basis and more generally because the 1994 action was, to outward appearances, conducted throughout in terms which assumed the existence and validity of the material damage policy, it seems to me that, whatever was intended, insurers' conduct of the 1994 action is also capable of constituting an unequivocal representation as to the validity of the material damage policy.\u000a

aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy.

The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies.

Following a comment which I made at the outset of the trial, he supplemented his report with certain literature from the library of the Chartered Insurance Institute, in particular an extract from Hickmott on Interruption Insurance and two prize papers from a 1987 essay competition, Dr R. A. Litton's Moral Hazard and Insurance Fraud and A.E.B. Alport's Risk and Behaviour: some notes towards a definition of moral hazard.\u000a

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p1045
aVIn his statement Mr Morris says that knowledge that inter-company transactions such as those represented by the Consolidator invoices existed and were fraudulent would have had a considerable impact on my attitude towards underwriting the policy, that it would have raised the question of moral hazard and, as a matter of policy, it would have caused me to discuss the matter with Mr Peter Walpole with a view to agreeing an appropriate course of action. Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent. I bear in mind that he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Walpole considered however that\u000a
p1046
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aVThe principles governing affirmation (or election) were considered in my previous judgment at p. 126. My conclusions in the context of that action appear at pp. 132-3. In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it. Provided that the party knows sufficient of the facts to know that he has that right, it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of those facts. Although this point was left open in \u000a

aVThe existence of the BCS and Consolidator invoices came to light during the course of discovery in the arbitrations around the middle of 1993. In mid-1993 Royal Hotel announced that its directors had concluded that its 1993 accounts should include a prior year adjustment reversing the transactions with BCS, which Royal Hotel's expert accountant in the business interruption arbitration (Mr Haberman) told insurers' expert (Mr Lee) on 6th October 1993 that he suspected had been included in Royal Hotel's accounts to massage the figures, though neither he nor Mrs Farnon knew why. Mr Haberman's report dated 5th October 1993 said that he had ascertained by discussion with Mrs Farnon and Mr McHugh that the rooms charged to Consolidator were occupied by related company employees and represent actual occupancy, but determined to leave them out of consideration on the basis that they do not represent a source of repeat or recommended business as would conventional occupants. A distinction was thus being drawn between the BCS and Consolidator invoices.\u000a
p1049
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a

aVThe previous action (the 1994 action) was begun on 24th January 1994. The statement of claim endorsed on the writ asserted that the statistics supplied to Cunningham Hart by Royal Hotel's letter dated 19th August 1992\u000a

aVwere knowingly false and misleading in that they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions. The Consolidator invoices are similar in all material respects to the BCS documentation and represent fictitious transactions.\u000a

aVOn 25th March 1994 Sir Patrick Neill Q.C. issued his first interim award in the material damage arbitration. Insurers' application for leave to appeal was dismissed by Longmore J. on 10th June 1994. Insurers then made a payment to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage award on 21st June 1994, obtaining an order on 28th July 1994 that involved payment of 950,000 into a joint account pending trial of the 1994 action. Royal Hotel's solicitors sought from Sir Patrick a second interim award for costs of the material damage arbitration, which they submitted should follow the event. After letters from them and Sir Patrick, Herbert Smith responded on 12th October 1994:\u000a
p1053
aVIn the 1994 action, points of reply and defence to counterclaim were served on 29th April 1994 and a request was made on 14th June 1994 for particulars of the allegations in the points of defence regarding contractors and accommodation and as to how the 150,000 was calculated to support the allegation that it was a reasonable sum for such accommodation.\u000a
p1054
aVDuring a meeting to discuss these particulars within Herbert Smith, Mr Bakes noted on his copy of this page of the particulars the words Moral hazard and Rel'ship with Banks. On about 22nd May 1995 witness statements by Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil were served in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh's statement confirmed that the contractors' workmen had been housed in staff accommodation (Ypres Guest House, Kingslynn and Fermoy) and other guest houses, and not therefore in the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices. The statement recounted that in mid-1991 the hotel had cash flow difficulties and was supported by Consolidator in a variety of ways, and went on:\u000a
p1055
aVOn 7th November 1995 Royal Hotel's solicitors sent Herbert Smith a detailed summary of costs and disbursements in the material damage arbitration seeking to reach agreement without need for taxation. On 22nd November 1995 Herbert Smith requested copy invoices relating to experts' and counsels' fees and other matters to enable them to consider the disbursements claimed in more detail, and these were then sent. After further pressure from Royal Hotel's solicitors to agree costs with a 10% discount against the sums claimed (failing which such solicitors threatened an application to vary the order relating to the 950,000), Herbert Smith wrote on 22nd December 1995 that they were seeking instructions and that Royal Hotel's time limit of 29th December 1995 was unreasonable, and again on 22nd December, after taking instructions, that Royal Hotel's offer was unacceptable. A letter from Herbert Smith to Royal Insurance of the same date recorded that the thinking behind this was, first, that insurers had good prospects of a better discount on taxation, secondly, that agreement on costs might simply provide Royal Hotel with a fighting fund for the impending trial of the fraud (i.e. 1994) action and, thirdly, that\u000a

aVIn November/December 1995 Mr Bakes with assistance from counsel prepared a draft amended statement of claim, which was served in January 1996 pursuant to leave granted on 13th December 1995. It added to the existing allegations, that the BCS and Consolidator transactions represented fictitious transactions, further allegations that they were\u000a

aV(b) they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions, which in whole or in part did not represent any or any real occupancy of the hotel and/or did not represent occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel. The Plaintiffs will say that such occupancy as there may have been by workmen employed for the benefit of the Defendants or either of them (as to which no admissions are made) was not occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel.\u000a
p1060
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a

aVThe trial of the 1994 action began on 7th February 1996. Judgment on claim and counterclaim were given on 5th July 1996 to the effect summarized at the start of this judgment. In the light of my judgment, insurers and Herbert Smith took independent expert advice on materiality, discussed materiality, inducement and the prospects of Royal Hotel establishing affirmation, decided to avoid the material damage insurance and on 12th August 1996 wrote accordingly.\u000a
p1062
aVHerbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims, as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters. The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence, in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance. Royal Insurance, which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI, thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and, as Mr Carter confirmed, to make judgments that required to be made during their course. Before me, Herbert Smith's state of mind and handling of both the arbitrations and the 1994 action have been treated for all purposes as synonymous with insurers'. No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance. This is relevant, since Herbert Smith at some points conducted matters without specific reference back to insurers.\u000a
p1063
aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a
p1064
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a
p1065
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p1066
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p1067
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p1068
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p1069
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a
p1070
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p1071
aVthere was a sense that actually as a matter of efficiently conducting this matter we should dispose of the fraud action because otherwise there would be a sense of wasting the court's time with lots of pleading and so on and lengthening the original trial.\u000a
p1072
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p1073
aVWe decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy.\u000a
p1074
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p1075
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p1076
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p1077
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a
p1078
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p1079
aVRoyal Hotel's case is that there were unequivocal acts by insurers as follows: (1) payment of sums under the material damage policy in June 1994; (2) conduct in treating the policy and/or awards under it as valid and enforceable, consisting in particular of (i) the prosecution of the 1994 action and defence to the counterclaim in it, (ii) the sequence of events leading to the second interim award under the material damage policy and (iii) the subsequent correspondence between parties with a view to agreeing the costs due under that award. Royal Hotel now seeks to add (iv) the consent order dated 24th July 1996 in the 1994 action, pursuant to which the balance of the material damage award was paid by insurers.\u000a
p1080
aVAs to (2), the original counterclaim in the 1994 action was for conspiracy in respect of both policies, with breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy appearing as a particular of conspiracy. The damage alleged consisted of loss suffered by delay due to the conspiracy in expeditious payment of claims under both policies. It would have been an answer to a claim for such damages (although, it may well be, not to the allegation of conspiracy itself) that the material damage policy had been avoided. The defence to counterclaim served 29th April 1994 pleaded:\u000a

aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a
p1082
aV 1969 2 Q.B. 507, (where it did not matter whether the agreement was void or voidable and the majority judgments are open to different interpretations). I am inclined to think that the agreement to make the interim payment would have fallen away automatically with avoidance of the material damage policy. On this limited basis and more generally because the 1994 action was, to outward appearances, conducted throughout in terms which assumed the existence and validity of the material damage policy, it seems to me that, whatever was intended, insurers' conduct of the 1994 action is also capable of constituting an unequivocal representation as to the validity of the material damage policy.\u000a
p1083
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p1084
aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a
p1085
aVfollows that insurers' action fails on the ground that insurers affirmed the material damage policy, despite their and legal advisers' unannounced internal intention not to do so.\u000a
p1086
aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all. They are, she submitted precluded on grounds of estoppel or abuse of process from doing so subsequently. This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

aV 1990 1 A.C. 723, 752, Balcombe L.J. expressed the view that appealability on the particular issue was no more than a test to decide whether a particular issue was fundamental to the court's substantive decision. These points were not argued before me, and I do no more than draw attention to them. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that my judgment in the 1994 action was adverse to insurers on the issue whether ICCI was in breach of the contract to pay 1 million under the material damage policy and in adjudicating that ICCI was liable to pay damages to be assessed for that breach. That conclusion could not have been reached unless the material damage policy continued in force.\u000a
p1094
aVThe other objection is that it is erroneous to treat an issue about avoidance which could only arise as and when insurers chose to avoid, as a defence or as an issue which could or should have been raised in the 1994 action at all. No such issue arose \u000a

aV (9th December 1993. In that case Minories Finance Ltd. (formerly Johnson Mathey Bankers Ltd. - JMB) claimed by writ issued in October 1991 in respect of monies of which they had on 25th February 1996 demanded payment from various companies in the Gomba group as guarantors of Gomba Exim Ltd. Previously, in mid-1995, JMB had demanded payment from the same companies of various other monies due from them as principal debtors or as guarantors of companies other than Gomba Exim Ltd., and judgments were given against such companies in respect of those monies on 16th January 1996. It was argued in the 1991 action that JMB was precluded under the wider principle in \u000a
p1096
aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a

aV, even if it were otherwise applicable, to apply it to a case where no cause of action existed at the relevant date but which might then have existed had JMB made the necessary demands on the plaintiffs.\u000a
p1098
aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p1099
aV presents an instructive contrast. In the first action (no.969), the appellant, Yat Tung, had claimed that an apparent mortgage to secure a loan to it was a sham and that it held the property as trustee for the bank, Dao Heng. Dao Heng counterclaimed for loss suffered by it on exercise by it of a power of sale contained in the mortgage, by virtue of which it sold the property to Choi Kee. In response to the counterclaim Yat Tung admitted the sale to Choi Kee, but denied that it owed any sum or that the bank had suffered any loss. Yat Tung lost both the claim and the counterclaim. In the second action (no.534), Yat Tung claimed against both the bank and Choi Kee that the sale was void or voidable as fraudulent in that both had, in effect, been conspiring to obtain the property at a gross undervalue. The issue was whether the allegation of fraud and voidability of the sale to Choi Kee were matters available for litigation in action no. 969: see page 5S8D. I observe, in parenthesis, that this formulation reflects what I would perceive to have been the position in law, namely that, if Yat Tung's allegations were well founded, they would have made the sale voidable, not void. The rules would have enabled such an issue to be raised by counterclaim to the counterclaim. That being so, the Privy Council applied \u000a
p1100
aVThis authority appears therefore to favour the view that there may be circumstances, in which a party who fails to take advantage of a right to avoid (of which he knew or ought to have known) in order to defeat a claim under or by reference to a contract, may be precluded from later doing so. Such an avoidance may be effected in and by the same pleading that raises it as an issue in the action. Although in a strict sense, a party has no defence unless and until he avoids, there is an element of unreality about this view of the matter. As responses to a claim, avoidance, breach of warranty, failure to perform a condition precedent to liability or a suggestion of fraudulent claim are in the ordinary course all probably considered and, where arguable, either deployed or rejected in litigation, without attention to whether they depend on some formal act which has effect in contract or equity outside insurers' pleading. Avoidance for non-disclosure does depend on such an act. Avoidance for breach of warranty now, on House of Lords authority, \u000a
p1101
aV into the field of exercise of substantive rights. Such an extension in the particular context of voidability of insurance contracts appears to me to reflect the commercial and practical realities which apply between parties to litigation such as the 1994 action, where the insurance contracts had no continuing significance save in respect of claims already paid or being pursued under them. I note, in passing, that in \u000a
p1102
aV. Lord Denning, who regarded the compromise agreement as voidable not void, nonetheless spoke of Mr Magee as having no no valid claim on the insurance policy (page 515A). That usage reflects the same reality. Apart from the claims which had been paid or were being pursued in respect of the material damage insurance policy, that policy had by the time of the 1994 action no significance for either party.\u000a
p1103
aVIn my judgment, the principle extended in this way in potentially applicable in the present context. Reliance was placed on the material damage policy in the counterclaims made by Royal Hotel against insurers in the 1994 action. Insurers met that reliance by accepting the existence of the material damage policy, but by denying any liability, whether for conspiracy or for breach, in respect of it. In one area, albeit minor, insurers lost on the case made against them of breach. The effect of their present case would be to undermine that conclusion, as well as to enable them to recover the sums paid under the material damage policy, which they could on the face of it also have counterclaimed to the counterclaim in the 1994 action. How the 1994 action would then have proceeded is a matter which cannot of course now be known for certain; but it would probably have been considered on the application for a split trial with which I in fact dealt with on 9th December 1994, as outlined on page 98 of my previous judgment, or at a later stage if the issue had been raised later.\u000a
p1104
aVThere would in practice probably also have been a claim to avoid the business interruption policy. The strong likelihood is that the issue of avoidance for non-disclosure, being relatively short and linked factually with the background issues in the 1994 action as well as the counterclaim, would have been tried and determined with all the other issues which I decided on 5th July 1996.\u000a
p1105
aVThere is in the circumstances no doubt that the issue of non-disclosure and avoidance could with reasonable diligence have been brought forward in the 1994 action. Was it one which properly belonged to the previous action? And, if it did, are there special circumstances which should lead to the non-application of the wider rule in \u000a
p1106
aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy. Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in \u000a
p1107
aVsee this as a case where special circumstances exist taking the matter outside the scope of that principle.  The court need not be too sympathetic to a tactical decision to postpone avoidance, in circumstances where, to all outward appearances and so far as the court was aware, the validity of the material damage policy was and remained throughout the course of the 1994 action unchallenged - as Mr Bakes, on the basis of his attendance note dated 23rd July 1996, also believed that Royal Hotel itself thought was the case.\u000a
p1108
aVHerbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims, as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters. The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence, in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance. Royal Insurance, which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI, thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and, as Mr Carter confirmed, to make judgments that required to be made during their course. Before me, Herbert Smith's state of mind and handling of both the arbitrations and the 1994 action have been treated for all purposes as synonymous with insurers'. No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance. This is relevant, since Herbert Smith at some points conducted matters without specific reference back to insurers.\u000a
p1109
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a
p1110
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

p1116
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1117
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a
p1118
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p1119
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996.

Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action?

This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a

aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p1122
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a

aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a

aV. Lord Denning, who regarded the compromise agreement as voidable not void, nonetheless spoke of Mr Magee as having no no valid claim on the insurance policy (page 515A). That usage reflects the same reality. Apart from the claims which had been paid or were being pursued in respect of the material damage insurance policy, that policy had by the time of the 1994 action no significance for either party.\u000a

aVIn his statement Mr Morris says that knowledge that inter-company transactions such as those represented by the Consolidator invoices existed and were fraudulent would have had a considerable impact on my attitude towards underwriting the policy, that it would have raised the question of moral hazard and, as a matter of policy, it would have caused me to discuss the matter with Mr Peter Walpole with a view to agreeing an appropriate course of action. Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent. I bear in mind that he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Walpole considered however that\u000a

aVThe existence of the BCS and Consolidator invoices came to light during the course of discovery in the arbitrations around the middle of 1993. In mid-1993 Royal Hotel announced that its directors had concluded that its 1993 accounts should include a prior year adjustment reversing the transactions with BCS, which Royal Hotel's expert accountant in the business interruption arbitration (Mr Haberman) told insurers' expert (Mr Lee) on 6th October 1993 that he suspected had been included in Royal Hotel's accounts to massage the figures, though neither he nor Mrs Farnon knew why. Mr Haberman's report dated 5th October 1993 said that he had ascertained by discussion with Mrs Farnon and Mr McHugh that the rooms charged to Consolidator were occupied by related company employees and represent actual occupancy, but determined to leave them out of consideration on the basis that they do not represent a source of repeat or recommended business as would conventional occupants. A distinction was thus being drawn between the BCS and Consolidator invoices.\u000a

aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a

aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a

aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a
p1131
aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy. Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in \u000a

aV presents an instructive contrast. In the first action (no.969), the appellant, Yat Tung, had claimed that an apparent mortgage to secure a loan to it was a sham and that it held the property as trustee for the bank, Dao Heng. Dao Heng counterclaimed for loss suffered by it on exercise by it of a power of sale contained in the mortgage, by virtue of which it sold the property to Choi Kee. In response to the counterclaim Yat Tung admitted the sale to Choi Kee, but denied that it owed any sum or that the bank had suffered any loss. Yat Tung lost both the claim and the counterclaim. In the second action (no.534), Yat Tung claimed against both the bank and Choi Kee that the sale was void or voidable as fraudulent in that both had, in effect, been conspiring to obtain the property at a gross undervalue. The issue was whether the allegation of fraud and voidability of the sale to Choi Kee were matters available for litigation in action no. 969: see page 5S8D. I observe, in parenthesis, that this formulation reflects what I would perceive to have been the position in law, namely that, if Yat Tung's allegations were well founded, they would have made the sale voidable, not void. The rules would have enabled such an issue to be raised by counterclaim to the counterclaim. That being so, the Privy Council applied \u000a

Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories.

aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a

aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a

aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation.

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a

Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a

aVRoyal Hotel's conduct in (1) to (5) related to poor trading performance, which could itself give a motive for extreme action to insurers' prejudice. Following a comment which I made at the outset of the trial, he supplemented his report with certain literature from the library of the Chartered Insurance Institute, in particular an extract from Hickmott on Interruption Insurance and two prize papers from a 1987 essay competition, Dr R. A. Litton's Moral Hazard and Insurance Fraud and A.E.B. Alport's Risk and Behaviour: some notes towards a definition of moral hazard.\u000a
p1152
aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p1153
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1154
aVThe principles governing affirmation (or election) were considered in my previous judgment at p. 126. My conclusions in the context of that action appear at pp. 132-3. In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it. Provided that the party knows sufficient of the facts to know that he has that right, it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of those facts. Although this point was left open in \u000a

aVIn the 1994 action, points of reply and defence to counterclaim were served on 29th April 1994 and a request was made on 14th June 1994 for particulars of the allegations in the points of defence regarding contractors and accommodation and as to how the 150,000 was calculated to support the allegation that it was a reasonable sum for such accommodation.\u000a
p1156
aVDuring a meeting to discuss these particulars within Herbert Smith, Mr Bakes noted on his copy of this page of the particulars the words Moral hazard and Rel'ship with Banks. On about 22nd May 1995 witness statements by Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil were served in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh's statement confirmed that the contractors' workmen had been housed in staff accommodation (Ypres Guest House, Kingslynn and Fermoy) and other guest houses, and not therefore in the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices. The statement recounted that in mid-1991 the hotel had cash flow difficulties and was supported by Consolidator in a variety of ways, and went on:\u000a
p1157
aV(b) they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions, which in whole or in part did not represent any or any real occupancy of the hotel and/or did not represent occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel. The Plaintiffs will say that such occupancy as there may have been by workmen employed for the benefit of the Defendants or either of them (as to which no admissions are made) was not occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel.\u000a
p1158
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p1159
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p1160
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a
p1161
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p1162
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p1163
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p1164
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p1165
aVRoyal Hotel's case is that there were unequivocal acts by insurers as follows: (1) payment of sums under the material damage policy in June 1994; (2) conduct in treating the policy and/or awards under it as valid and enforceable, consisting in particular of (i) the prosecution of the 1994 action and defence to the counterclaim in it, (ii) the sequence of events leading to the second interim award under the material damage policy and (iii) the subsequent correspondence between parties with a view to agreeing the costs due under that award. Royal Hotel now seeks to add (iv) the consent order dated 24th July 1996 in the 1994 action, pursuant to which the balance of the material damage award was paid by insurers.\u000a
p1166
aVAs to (2), the original counterclaim in the 1994 action was for conspiracy in respect of both policies, with breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy appearing as a particular of conspiracy. The damage alleged consisted of loss suffered by delay due to the conspiracy in expeditious payment of claims under both policies. It would have been an answer to a claim for such damages (although, it may well be, not to the allegation of conspiracy itself) that the material damage policy had been avoided. The defence to counterclaim served 29th April 1994 pleaded:\u000a
p1167
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p1168
aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a
p1169
aVThe relevant parties before me were parties to the 1994 litigation. The judgment in that action is final and conclusive on the merits of the matters decided. But the validity of the material damage policy was not in issue in the 1994 action. The first head of jurisdiction identified in the authorities, \u000a

aV can only apply when there has been a decision in the prior proceedings adverse to the party now seeking to pursue further litigation: see The Doctrine of Res Judicata by Spencer Bower (2nd Ed., 1969) paragraphs 197 and 203. This qualification inter-relates with the rule, mentioned in Chitty paragraph 25-010, that cause of action and issue estoppel only apply to issues which it was necessary to determine for the purpose of resolving the previous proceedings. Issues which a court may in passing have decided or assumed against a party but in respect of which he could not \u000a

aV 1990 1 A.C. 723, 752, Balcombe L.J. expressed the view that appealability on the particular issue was no more than a test to decide whether a particular issue was fundamental to the court's substantive decision. These points were not argued before me, and I do no more than draw attention to them. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that my judgment in the 1994 action was adverse to insurers on the issue whether ICCI was in breach of the contract to pay 1 million under the material damage policy and in adjudicating that ICCI was liable to pay damages to be assessed for that breach. That conclusion could not have been reached unless the material damage policy continued in force.\u000a
p1173
aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a
p1174
aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p1175
aVThis authority appears therefore to favour the view that there may be circumstances, in which a party who fails to take advantage of a right to avoid (of which he knew or ought to have known) in order to defeat a claim under or by reference to a contract, may be precluded from later doing so. Such an avoidance may be effected in and by the same pleading that raises it as an issue in the action. Although in a strict sense, a party has no defence unless and until he avoids, there is an element of unreality about this view of the matter. As responses to a claim, avoidance, breach of warranty, failure to perform a condition precedent to liability or a suggestion of fraudulent claim are in the ordinary course all probably considered and, where arguable, either deployed or rejected in litigation, without attention to whether they depend on some formal act which has effect in contract or equity outside insurers' pleading. Avoidance for non-disclosure does depend on such an act. Avoidance for breach of warranty now, on House of Lords authority, \u000a

aV into the field of exercise of substantive rights. Such an extension in the particular context of voidability of insurance contracts appears to me to reflect the commercial and practical realities which apply between parties to litigation such as the 1994 action, where the insurance contracts had no continuing significance save in respect of claims already paid or being pursued under them. I note, in passing, that in \u000a
p1177
aV. Lord Denning, who regarded the compromise agreement as voidable not void, nonetheless spoke of Mr Magee as having no no valid claim on the insurance policy (page 515A). That usage reflects the same reality. Apart from the claims which had been paid or were being pursued in respect of the material damage insurance policy, that policy had by the time of the 1994 action no significance for either party.\u000a
p1178
aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy. Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in \u000a
p1179
aVIn his statement Mr Morris says that knowledge that inter-company transactions such as those represented by the Consolidator invoices existed and were fraudulent would have had a considerable impact on my attitude towards underwriting the policy, that it would have raised the question of moral hazard and, as a matter of policy, it would have caused me to discuss the matter with Mr Peter Walpole with a view to agreeing an appropriate course of action. Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent. I bear in mind that he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Walpole considered however that\u000a

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p1185
aVThe principles governing affirmation (or election) were considered in my previous judgment at p. 126. My conclusions in the context of that action appear at pp. 132-3. In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it. Provided that the party knows sufficient of the facts to know that he has that right, it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of those facts. Although this point was left open in \u000a
p1186
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a
p1187
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p1188
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p1189
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a
p1190
aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p1191
aVThis authority appears therefore to favour the view that there may be circumstances, in which a party who fails to take advantage of a right to avoid (of which he knew or ought to have known) in order to defeat a claim under or by reference to a contract, may be precluded from later doing so. Such an avoidance may be effected in and by the same pleading that raises it as an issue in the action. Although in a strict sense, a party has no defence unless and until he avoids, there is an element of unreality about this view of the matter. As responses to a claim, avoidance, breach of warranty, failure to perform a condition precedent to liability or a suggestion of fraudulent claim are in the ordinary course all probably considered and, where arguable, either deployed or rejected in litigation, without attention to whether they depend on some formal act which has effect in contract or equity outside insurers' pleading. Avoidance for non-disclosure does depend on such an act. Avoidance for breach of warranty now, on House of Lords authority, \u000a

aV into the field of exercise of substantive rights. Such an extension in the particular context of voidability of insurance contracts appears to me to reflect the commercial and practical realities which apply between parties to litigation such as the 1994 action, where the insurance contracts had no continuing significance save in respect of claims already paid or being pursued under them. I note, in passing, that in \u000a
p1193
aV can only apply when there has been a decision in the prior proceedings adverse to the party now seeking to pursue further litigation: see The Doctrine of Res Judicata by Spencer Bower (2nd Ed., 1969) paragraphs 197 and 203. This qualification inter-relates with the rule, mentioned in Chitty paragraph 25-010, that cause of action and issue estoppel only apply to issues which it was necessary to determine for the purpose of resolving the previous proceedings. Issues which a court may in passing have decided or assumed against a party but in respect of which he could not \u000a

aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a
p1195
aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a
p1196
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1197
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a
p1198
aVwere knowingly false and misleading in that they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions. The Consolidator invoices are similar in all material respects to the BCS documentation and represent fictitious transactions.\u000a
p1199
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p1200
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p1201
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p1202
aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a

In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it.

Although this point was left open in \u000a

aVIn the 1994 action, points of reply and defence to counterclaim were served on 29th April 1994 and a request was made on 14th June 1994 for particulars of the allegations in the points of defence regarding contractors and accommodation and as to how the 150,000 was calculated to support the allegation that it was a reasonable sum for such accommodation.\u000a
p1205
aVDuring a meeting to discuss these particulars within Herbert Smith, Mr Bakes noted on his copy of this page of the particulars the words Moral hazard and Rel'ship with Banks. On about 22nd May 1995 witness statements by Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil were served in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh's statement confirmed that the contractors' workmen had been housed in staff accommodation (Ypres Guest House, Kingslynn and Fermoy) and other guest houses, and not therefore in the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices. The statement recounted that in mid-1991 the hotel had cash flow difficulties and was supported by Consolidator in a variety of ways, and went on:\u000a

p1207
aV 1990 1 A.C. 723, 752, Balcombe L.J. expressed the view that appealability on the particular issue was no more than a test to decide whether a particular issue was fundamental to the court's substantive decision. These points were not argued before me, and I do no more than draw attention to them. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that my judgment in the 1994 action was adverse to insurers on the issue whether ICCI was in breach of the contract to pay 1 million under the material damage policy and in adjudicating that ICCI was liable to pay damages to be assessed for that breach. That conclusion could not have been reached unless the material damage policy continued in force.\u000a

If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct.

p1212
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p1213
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a
p1214
aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a
p1215
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories.

aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a

aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a

p1221
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p1222
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p1223
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a

p1226
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p1227
aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all. They are, she submitted precluded on grounds of estoppel or abuse of process from doing so subsequently. This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a
p1229
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a

aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1239
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a
p1240
aVIn my judgment, the principle extended in this way in potentially applicable in the present context. Reliance was placed on the material damage policy in the counterclaims made by Royal Hotel against insurers in the 1994 action. Insurers met that reliance by accepting the existence of the material damage policy, but by denying any liability, whether for conspiracy or for breach, in respect of it. In one area, albeit minor, insurers lost on the case made against them of breach. The effect of their present case would be to undermine that conclusion, as well as to enable them to recover the sums paid under the material damage policy, which they could on the face of it also have counterclaimed to the counterclaim in the 1994 action. How the 1994 action would then have proceeded is a matter which cannot of course now be known for certain; but it would probably have been considered on the application for a split trial with which I in fact dealt with on 9th December 1994, as outlined on page 98 of my previous judgment, or at a later stage if the issue had been raised later.\u000a

aVThis action is by way of sequel to \u000a
p1242
aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a

aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p1247
aVIn his statement Mr Morris says that knowledge that inter-company transactions such as those represented by the Consolidator invoices existed and were fraudulent would have had a considerable impact on my attitude towards underwriting the policy, that it would have raised the question of moral hazard and, as a matter of policy, it would have caused me to discuss the matter with Mr Peter Walpole with a view to agreeing an appropriate course of action. Reading his statement, including the note to it, as a whole, I do not think that he meant more by fraudulent inter-company transactions than that they were brought into existence with dishonest intent. I bear in mind that he was not tendered for cross-examination.  Mr Walpole considered however that\u000a
p1248
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1249
aVThe principles governing affirmation (or election) were considered in my previous judgment at p. 126. My conclusions in the context of that action appear at pp. 132-3. In summary, the type of affirmation here in issue involves an informed choice (to treat the contract as continuing) made with knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to avoid it. Provided that the party knows sufficient of the facts to know that he has that right, it is unnecessary that he should know all aspects or incidents of those facts. Although this point was left open in \u000a

aVThe existence of the BCS and Consolidator invoices came to light during the course of discovery in the arbitrations around the middle of 1993. In mid-1993 Royal Hotel announced that its directors had concluded that its 1993 accounts should include a prior year adjustment reversing the transactions with BCS, which Royal Hotel's expert accountant in the business interruption arbitration (Mr Haberman) told insurers' expert (Mr Lee) on 6th October 1993 that he suspected had been included in Royal Hotel's accounts to massage the figures, though neither he nor Mrs Farnon knew why. Mr Haberman's report dated 5th October 1993 said that he had ascertained by discussion with Mrs Farnon and Mr McHugh that the rooms charged to Consolidator were occupied by related company employees and represent actual occupancy, but determined to leave them out of consideration on the basis that they do not represent a source of repeat or recommended business as would conventional occupants. A distinction was thus being drawn between the BCS and Consolidator invoices.\u000a
p1251
aVFor present purposes it is insurers' state of mind regarding the Consolidator transactions which is critical. Herbert Smith's letter dated 19th October 1993 recorded that insurers were deeply troubled about both the BCS and Consolidator transactions. It said that prima facie the BCS invoices appeared to be dishonest documents, that Price Waterhouse (in the person of Mr Lee) had been unable to think of any other explanation for them and that, although Royal Hotel had sought to distinguish the Consolidator invoices, they are very similar, and your clients have declined to provide any details to support their suggestion that Consolidator received significant consideration for the charges made to it. It went on to assert that the failure to call either Mrs Farnon or Mr McHugh\u000a
p1252
aVThe previous action (the 1994 action) was begun on 24th January 1994. The statement of claim endorsed on the writ asserted that the statistics supplied to Cunningham Hart by Royal Hotel's letter dated 19th August 1992\u000a
p1253
aVwere knowingly false and misleading in that they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions. The Consolidator invoices are similar in all material respects to the BCS documentation and represent fictitious transactions.\u000a
p1254
aVOn 25th March 1994 Sir Patrick Neill Q.C. issued his first interim award in the material damage arbitration. Insurers' application for leave to appeal was dismissed by Longmore J. on 10th June 1994. Insurers then made a payment to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage award on 21st June 1994, obtaining an order on 28th July 1994 that involved payment of 950,000 into a joint account pending trial of the 1994 action. Royal Hotel's solicitors sought from Sir Patrick a second interim award for costs of the material damage arbitration, which they submitted should follow the event. After letters from them and Sir Patrick, Herbert Smith responded on 12th October 1994:\u000a
p1255
aVIn the 1994 action, points of reply and defence to counterclaim were served on 29th April 1994 and a request was made on 14th June 1994 for particulars of the allegations in the points of defence regarding contractors and accommodation and as to how the 150,000 was calculated to support the allegation that it was a reasonable sum for such accommodation.\u000a
p1256
aVDuring a meeting to discuss these particulars within Herbert Smith, Mr Bakes noted on his copy of this page of the particulars the words Moral hazard and Rel'ship with Banks. On about 22nd May 1995 witness statements by Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil were served in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh's statement confirmed that the contractors' workmen had been housed in staff accommodation (Ypres Guest House, Kingslynn and Fermoy) and other guest houses, and not therefore in the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices. The statement recounted that in mid-1991 the hotel had cash flow difficulties and was supported by Consolidator in a variety of ways, and went on:\u000a
p1257
aVOn 7th November 1995 Royal Hotel's solicitors sent Herbert Smith a detailed summary of costs and disbursements in the material damage arbitration seeking to reach agreement without need for taxation. On 22nd November 1995 Herbert Smith requested copy invoices relating to experts' and counsels' fees and other matters to enable them to consider the disbursements claimed in more detail, and these were then sent. After further pressure from Royal Hotel's solicitors to agree costs with a 10% discount against the sums claimed (failing which such solicitors threatened an application to vary the order relating to the 950,000), Herbert Smith wrote on 22nd December 1995 that they were seeking instructions and that Royal Hotel's time limit of 29th December 1995 was unreasonable, and again on 22nd December, after taking instructions, that Royal Hotel's offer was unacceptable. A letter from Herbert Smith to Royal Insurance of the same date recorded that the thinking behind this was, first, that insurers had good prospects of a better discount on taxation, secondly, that agreement on costs might simply provide Royal Hotel with a fighting fund for the impending trial of the fraud (i.e. 1994) action and, thirdly, that\u000a

aV(c) Consideration is to be given to the possible impact of the outcome of the fraud action on the material damage award. It is safe to assume that any money paid over to Royal Hotel will be extremely difficult to recover.\u000a
p1259
aVIn November/December 1995 Mr Bakes with assistance from counsel prepared a draft amended statement of claim, which was served in January 1996 pursuant to leave granted on 13th December 1995. It added to the existing allegations, that the BCS and Consolidator transactions represented fictitious transactions, further allegations that they were\u000a

p1261
aV(b) they included figures relating to the BCS and Consolidator transactions, which in whole or in part did not represent any or any real occupancy of the hotel and/or did not represent occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel. The Plaintiffs will say that such occupancy as there may have been by workmen employed for the benefit of the Defendants or either of them (as to which no admissions are made) was not occupancy of the hotel in the ordinary course of its business as a hotel.\u000a
p1262
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a
p1263
aVThe trial of the 1994 action began on 7th February 1996. Judgment on claim and counterclaim were given on 5th July 1996 to the effect summarized at the start of this judgment. In the light of my judgment, insurers and Herbert Smith took independent expert advice on materiality, discussed materiality, inducement and the prospects of Royal Hotel establishing affirmation, decided to avoid the material damage insurance and on 12th August 1996 wrote accordingly.\u000a
p1264
aVHerbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims, as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters. The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence, in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance. Royal Insurance, which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI, thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and, as Mr Carter confirmed, to make judgments that required to be made during their course. Before me, Herbert Smith's state of mind and handling of both the arbitrations and the 1994 action have been treated for all purposes as synonymous with insurers'. No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance. This is relevant, since Herbert Smith at some points conducted matters without specific reference back to insurers.\u000a
p1265
aVMr Carter's evidence was that, since fraud is a very serious allegation, he would in general only advance such a case where there was clear evidence and no satisfactory explanation. Herbert Smith's letters dated 19th October and 23rd November 1993 were drafted by Herbert Smith, who had a much more detailed understanding of the facts than me but he saw and approved them before they were sent. His statement said that he remembered being of the view that it remained possible that Royal Hotel would come up with an explanation for the BCS and Consolidator invoices. He saw the statement of claim and points of defence in the 1994 action in January and March 1994, but did not analyse them, leaving the running of the action to Herbert Smith. Herbert Smith had drawn his attention to paragraph 18.17 of the points of defence, which indicated that the invoices were created around the time when they were dated; it was also surprising in so far as it indicated that they related to staff accommodation. When payment was made in respect of the material damage award in June 1994, he was not aware of any case against Royal Hotel which would permit insurers to avoid the material damage policy and withhold such payment. During the trial of the 1994 action, he believed that insurers' case would be upheld, but we were, however, by no means sure of how the facts would emerge and remained fully reserved for our line at, I believe, 10m until we received the judgment .....\u000a
p1266
aVMr Bakes's statement, which was adduced as his evidence in chief, described how a question-mark arose over the honesty of the BCS transactions as a result of their reversal in Royal Hotel's accounts in late June 1993, Mr Lee's advice that he could not think of an honest explanation and a comment by counsel for Royal Hotel in the arbitration that they had taken place in order to boost the revenue of the Royal Hotel. But, Mr Bakes said, as best as he could recall he was waiting to hear what Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon said in cross-examination. The Consolidator invoices looked very similar, and Royal Hotel's solicitors had not explained any difference, but they had not been reversed. Mr Haberman's report maintained that the distinction lay in actual occupancy, although he withdrew reliance upon the Consolidator invoices. Only after the refusal to call Mr McHugh and Mrs Farnon in arbitration, did Mr Bakes carry out a full factual analysis, when preparing the letter dated 19th October 1993. That letter was seeking to ensure that they had as much information as possible, including any explanations from the insured, before advising their clients on the question of fraud. As to the letter dated 23rd November 1993 written after Royal Hotel's refusal to give any further explanation, Mr Bakes recalled that he probably did speculate whether it would make any difference to insurers' case on fraud in the claims context, if the BCS and Consolidator invoices had been prepared initially not to defraud insurers, but to mislead others such as Royal Hotel's bankers, and concluded that it would not, if the invoices had subsequently been used dishonestly to present the claim. He said that his state of mind regarding the Consolidator invoices, both then and later when drafting proceedings, was that\u000a
p1267
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a
p1268
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p1269
aVThis account of the thinking in and after November 1994 was not recorded in any contemporaneous document. The only documents, privileged or unprivileged, which bear on the present issues in the whole period from November 1994 to the date of my judgment in the 1994 action, are Mr Bakes' copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard and the letter dated 22nd December 1995. Further, the reference to providing objective and dispassionate advice does not mean that any advice was in fact given to insurers following the discussion of November 1994. On the evidence, the consequence of whatever view was then taken was that no mention was made to insurers of any possible avoidance point. Any communication with Royal Insurance on such a point would in practice have been by Mr Higgins. Mr Bakes did not speak to Royal Insurance on the point until early 1996. He had a very vague recollection of Mr Higgins telling him at some point that he had mentioned the point to Mr Carter, but could give no time or detail. In the light of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that this mention did not occur until late 1995, shortly before Ms Kydd's letter dated 22nd December 1995.\u000a
p1270
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p1271
aVIn short our case on affirmation and/or estoppel is that both these matters depend upon the party alleged to have affirmed or be estopped having full knowledge of the facts. Until service of the further and better particulars in late 1994 we did not have the requisite knowledge. From that time as you know, it has been recognized that the point might be available to be taken. The judgment that was rightly exercised at that stage was that to take the point at that time might have a disastrous impact on the allegations of fraud and would put that case in jeopardy. In any event it did not appear that any steps were to be taken (and were in fact taken) before the trial and determination of the fraud action which would amount to an act of affirmation of the material damage policy. In summary therefore I do not consider that any affirmation/estoppel case advanced by the insured should succeed.\u000a
p1272
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p1273
aVthere was a sense that actually as a matter of efficiently conducting this matter we should dispose of the fraud action because otherwise there would be a sense of wasting the court's time with lots of pleading and so on and lengthening the original trial.\u000a
p1274
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p1275
aVWe decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy.\u000a
p1276
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a
p1277
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p1278
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p1279
aVcorrectly explains the thinking behind this tactical decision. It is more likely that it was a litigators' decision to concentrate on the claim in hand, and on the central and solid issues which it raised about which Herbert Smith were already confident. Insurers were not looking to Herbert Smith to do more than win that case. Once it was won, the material damage policy could be revisited without diversion of energy to matters which Herbert Smith and their clients did not then regard as being of primary concern, and without any risk of giving any sign of weakness to anyone. If, after a successful outcome of the business interruption action, steps could be taken which offered the prospect by litigation or compromise of some recoupment of monies in relation to the material damage policy, that would be pure benefit without any real downside. This thinking was it appears encouraged by the belief, reflected in Mr Bakes's letter dated 31st July 1996, that it would be possible to avoid any step which could be taken as an unequivocal affirmation by insurers.\u000a
p1280
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a
p1281
aVRoyal Hotel's case is that there were unequivocal acts by insurers as follows: (1) payment of sums under the material damage policy in June 1994; (2) conduct in treating the policy and/or awards under it as valid and enforceable, consisting in particular of (i) the prosecution of the 1994 action and defence to the counterclaim in it, (ii) the sequence of events leading to the second interim award under the material damage policy and (iii) the subsequent correspondence between parties with a view to agreeing the costs due under that award. Royal Hotel now seeks to add (iv) the consent order dated 24th July 1996 in the 1994 action, pursuant to which the balance of the material damage award was paid by insurers.\u000a
p1282
aVAs to (2), the original counterclaim in the 1994 action was for conspiracy in respect of both policies, with breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy appearing as a particular of conspiracy. The damage alleged consisted of loss suffered by delay due to the conspiracy in expeditious payment of claims under both policies. It would have been an answer to a claim for such damages (although, it may well be, not to the allegation of conspiracy itself) that the material damage policy had been avoided. The defence to counterclaim served 29th April 1994 pleaded:\u000a
p1283
aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period. Nonetheless, the trial was fought before me in terms which recognized the existence of the material damage policy. If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable. Its underlying assumption was the existence and validity of the material damage insurance. Whether avoidance of the material damage policy would have made the agreement to make the interim payment under the material damage policy void or voidable may be a nice point, which was not addressed by submissions before me. An agreement to make an interim payment under a policy appears, if anything, even more obviously dependant on the validity of that policy than the agreement to compromise a claim in ignorance of right to avoid considered in \u000a

aV 1969 2 Q.B. 507, (where it did not matter whether the agreement was void or voidable and the majority judgments are open to different interpretations). I am inclined to think that the agreement to make the interim payment would have fallen away automatically with avoidance of the material damage policy. On this limited basis and more generally because the 1994 action was, to outward appearances, conducted throughout in terms which assumed the existence and validity of the material damage policy, it seems to me that, whatever was intended, insurers' conduct of the 1994 action is also capable of constituting an unequivocal representation as to the validity of the material damage policy.\u000a
p1285
aVThe unusual feature that Royal Hotel was itself denying any dishonest conduct in the course of the 1994 action makes it necessary to focus more closely on the requirement that the conduct relied on as affirmation constituted a sufficiently unequivocal representation of choice. Insurers themselves had, I have concluded, the requisite knowledge from November 1994. Royal Hotel was throughout denying any dishonesty, but it must have known that its denial was untruthful and may very well have had a shrewd appreciation that the denial was not making any impact on insurers. But Royal Hotel's own state of mind is not the test. The test is whether a reasonable person, in Royal Hotel's position and with its knowledge, would have regarded insurers as making an unequivocal representation or choice. That depends upon what a reasonable person could and would infer about insurers' knowledge. Insurers' own actual knowledge derived from a common sense consideration of documents and information which Royal Hotel had supplied. Although Royal Hotel continued to brazen it out, it seems to me that a reasonable person would have reached exactly the same conclusion that Herbert Smith reached, namely that these were dishonest and fictitious invoices deliberately created by Mr McHugh to distort the hotel's trading in the eyes of persons such as bankers. In these circumstances, I consider that the conduct which I have identified did constitute affirmation, in particular (a) insurers' and their advisers' conduct in late 1994 and early 1995 in relation to the second interim award on costs and (b) their conduct of the 1994 action, especially after the amendment and reamendment of the points of counterclaim to claim damages directly for breach of the agreement made under the material damage policy.\u000a
p1286
aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a

aVfollows that insurers' action fails on the ground that insurers affirmed the material damage policy, despite their and legal advisers' unannounced internal intention not to do so.\u000a
p1288
aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all. They are, she submitted precluded on grounds of estoppel or abuse of process from doing so subsequently. This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

p1290
aVThe relevant parties before me were parties to the 1994 litigation. The judgment in that action is final and conclusive on the merits of the matters decided. But the validity of the material damage policy was not in issue in the 1994 action. The first head of jurisdiction identified in the authorities, \u000a
p1291
aVin the narrow sense, is not available. The wider head of jurisdiction requires consideration whether insurers could and should have put the voidability of the material damage policy in issue in the 1994 action, and should be held precluded from doing so in the present fresh action.\u000a

aV can only apply when there has been a decision in the prior proceedings adverse to the party now seeking to pursue further litigation: see The Doctrine of Res Judicata by Spencer Bower (2nd Ed., 1969) paragraphs 197 and 203. This qualification inter-relates with the rule, mentioned in Chitty paragraph 25-010, that cause of action and issue estoppel only apply to issues which it was necessary to determine for the purpose of resolving the previous proceedings. Issues which a court may in passing have decided or assumed against a party but in respect of which he could not \u000a

aV, The requirement of an adverse decision, on the particular issue and on the action as a whole, cannot however be absolute. For example, under the narrower principle in \u000a
p1295
aV 1990 1 A.C. 723, 752, Balcombe L.J. expressed the view that appealability on the particular issue was no more than a test to decide whether a particular issue was fundamental to the court's substantive decision. These points were not argued before me, and I do no more than draw attention to them. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that my judgment in the 1994 action was adverse to insurers on the issue whether ICCI was in breach of the contract to pay 1 million under the material damage policy and in adjudicating that ICCI was liable to pay damages to be assessed for that breach. That conclusion could not have been reached unless the material damage policy continued in force.\u000a
p1296
aVThe other objection is that it is erroneous to treat an issue about avoidance which could only arise as and when insurers chose to avoid, as a defence or as an issue which could or should have been raised in the 1994 action at all. No such issue arose \u000a

aV (9th December 1993. In that case Minories Finance Ltd. (formerly Johnson Mathey Bankers Ltd. - JMB) claimed by writ issued in October 1991 in respect of monies of which they had on 25th February 1996 demanded payment from various companies in the Gomba group as guarantors of Gomba Exim Ltd. Previously, in mid-1995, JMB had demanded payment from the same companies of various other monies due from them as principal debtors or as guarantors of companies other than Gomba Exim Ltd., and judgments were given against such companies in respect of those monies on 16th January 1996. It was argued in the 1991 action that JMB was precluded under the wider principle in \u000a
p1298
aV from pursuing the claims made in the 1991 action, since they could with reasonable diligence have been made in the 1985-86 proceedings. The argument failed. Under the terms of the Gomba Exim guarantees, no cause of action arose against the companies unless and until a demand was made, and no demand was made until 25th February 1986 - that is, after the previous judgments. Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a
p1299
aV, even if it were otherwise applicable, to apply it to a case where no cause of action existed at the relevant date but which might then have existed had JMB made the necessary demands on the plaintiffs.\u000a
p1300
aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p1301
aV presents an instructive contrast. In the first action (no.969), the appellant, Yat Tung, had claimed that an apparent mortgage to secure a loan to it was a sham and that it held the property as trustee for the bank, Dao Heng. Dao Heng counterclaimed for loss suffered by it on exercise by it of a power of sale contained in the mortgage, by virtue of which it sold the property to Choi Kee. In response to the counterclaim Yat Tung admitted the sale to Choi Kee, but denied that it owed any sum or that the bank had suffered any loss. Yat Tung lost both the claim and the counterclaim. In the second action (no.534), Yat Tung claimed against both the bank and Choi Kee that the sale was void or voidable as fraudulent in that both had, in effect, been conspiring to obtain the property at a gross undervalue. The issue was whether the allegation of fraud and voidability of the sale to Choi Kee were matters available for litigation in action no. 969: see page 5S8D. I observe, in parenthesis, that this formulation reflects what I would perceive to have been the position in law, namely that, if Yat Tung's allegations were well founded, they would have made the sale voidable, not void. The rules would have enabled such an issue to be raised by counterclaim to the counterclaim. That being so, the Privy Council applied \u000a
p1302
aVThis authority appears therefore to favour the view that there may be circumstances, in which a party who fails to take advantage of a right to avoid (of which he knew or ought to have known) in order to defeat a claim under or by reference to a contract, may be precluded from later doing so. Such an avoidance may be effected in and by the same pleading that raises it as an issue in the action. Although in a strict sense, a party has no defence unless and until he avoids, there is an element of unreality about this view of the matter. As responses to a claim, avoidance, breach of warranty, failure to perform a condition precedent to liability or a suggestion of fraudulent claim are in the ordinary course all probably considered and, where arguable, either deployed or rejected in litigation, without attention to whether they depend on some formal act which has effect in contract or equity outside insurers' pleading. Avoidance for non-disclosure does depend on such an act. Avoidance for breach of warranty now, on House of Lords authority, \u000a
p1303
aV into the field of exercise of substantive rights. Such an extension in the particular context of voidability of insurance contracts appears to me to reflect the commercial and practical realities which apply between parties to litigation such as the 1994 action, where the insurance contracts had no continuing significance save in respect of claims already paid or being pursued under them. I note, in passing, that in \u000a
p1304
aV. Lord Denning, who regarded the compromise agreement as voidable not void, nonetheless spoke of Mr Magee as having no no valid claim on the insurance policy (page 515A). That usage reflects the same reality. Apart from the claims which had been paid or were being pursued in respect of the material damage insurance policy, that policy had by the time of the 1994 action no significance for either party.\u000a
p1305
aVIn my judgment, the principle extended in this way in potentially applicable in the present context. Reliance was placed on the material damage policy in the counterclaims made by Royal Hotel against insurers in the 1994 action. Insurers met that reliance by accepting the existence of the material damage policy, but by denying any liability, whether for conspiracy or for breach, in respect of it. In one area, albeit minor, insurers lost on the case made against them of breach. The effect of their present case would be to undermine that conclusion, as well as to enable them to recover the sums paid under the material damage policy, which they could on the face of it also have counterclaimed to the counterclaim in the 1994 action. How the 1994 action would then have proceeded is a matter which cannot of course now be known for certain; but it would probably have been considered on the application for a split trial with which I in fact dealt with on 9th December 1994, as outlined on page 98 of my previous judgment, or at a later stage if the issue had been raised later.\u000a
p1306
aVThere would in practice probably also have been a claim to avoid the business interruption policy. The strong likelihood is that the issue of avoidance for non-disclosure, being relatively short and linked factually with the background issues in the 1994 action as well as the counterclaim, would have been tried and determined with all the other issues which I decided on 5th July 1996.\u000a
p1307
aVThere is in the circumstances no doubt that the issue of non-disclosure and avoidance could with reasonable diligence have been brought forward in the 1994 action. Was it one which properly belonged to the previous action? And, if it did, are there special circumstances which should lead to the non-application of the wider rule in \u000a
p1308
aV? The arguments on these two points overlap. Mr Veeder submits that his clients were justified in viewing the counterclaim as substantially misconceived. Any issues under the material damage policy were, he suggested, subsidiary, or, at all events, the only issue on which insurers lost was very subsidiary. In these circumstances, any claim to avoid the material damage policy did not properly belong to the 1994 action, or there were special circumstances why the court should not hold insurers precluded from pursuing it, even though it would undermine a minor part of the previous judgment. In my judgment, despite the tactical considerations which led Herbert Smith to the course which they and insurers took, any issue regarding the voidability of the material damage policy was so closely connected with the subject matter of the counterclaim that it did properly belong in the 1994 action. It could and would have been accommodated there and, in all likelihood, tried together with the other issues which I determined in the 1994 action. That the only issue depending upon the validity of the material damage policy upon which insurers lost was a subsidiary issue could be more directly important if insurers had sought to avoid that policy but had, after judgment, decided not to appeal on the issue because of its insignificance. Here, however, there was a tactical decision not to take any point about the validity of the material damage policy in an action in which the defendants were counterclaiming on a relatively broad basis which assumed and depended in one way or another upon the validity of the material damage policy. Although I have in mind the underlying basis of the wider principle in \u000a
p1309
aVsee this as a case where special circumstances exist taking the matter outside the scope of that principle.  The court need not be too sympathetic to a tactical decision to postpone avoidance, in circumstances where, to all outward appearances and so far as the court was aware, the validity of the material damage policy was and remained throughout the course of the 1994 action unchallenged - as Mr Bakes, on the basis of his attendance note dated 23rd July 1996, also believed that Royal Hotel itself thought was the case.\u000a
p1310
aVAt the end of January 1996 Royal Hotel served supplementary statements from Mr McHugh and Mr Anquetil in the 1994 action. Mr McHugh insisted that his instructions to Mr Anquetil to raise the BCS and Consolidator charges were given pre-fire in mid-June 1991 and March/April 1992 and were nothing more than a straightforward way of providing internal support, which it was Mr Anquetil's job to process. Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories. He suggested that this was because charges had to be allocated for management account and general ledger purposes and\u000a
p1311
aVWe decided that the prudent course was to see how the facts emerged at trial and in particular what findings of fact were made by the judge at trial before giving further consideration to a possible non-disclosure case.  I was concerned, for example, that Royal Hotel might call evidence from its bankers saying that they had been fully informed of the circumstances which lay behind the invoices. I was also concerned that Royal Hotel (as had been contended in the letter of 11th June 1993) had allocated the rooms shown in the Consolidator invoices to Consolidator and that whilst these rooms had not been occupied, the allocation might be sufficient to justify the invoices. I recognized that this was not a case that Royal Hotel had yet advanced in the action and that if it was raised it would of itself raise a number of questions about the availability of rooms for occupation, but given that it had successfully changed its case in the arbitration at the last minute I felt that it might do something similar in this action as well. We felt that because of these uncertainties the correct course was to await the outcome of the fraud action.\u000a
p1312
aVAlthough the discussion within Herbert Smith in November 1994 was short, Mr Bakes's account of his thinking in the paragraphs which I have summarized was detailed. It does however face the problem that insurers were already alleging fraud, involving reliance on both the BCS and the Consolidator transactions as fictitious.  The concerns and scruples emphasized by Mr Bakes's statement had not prevented Herbert Smith as experienced litigators from pleading fraud. According to Mr Bakes's oral evidence, the adverse view of the honesty of those behind Royal Hotel which he had formed had in fact been a factor encouraging him in his plea of fraud in the January 1994 statement of claim. It is clear that nothing since then can have done anything to diminish that view. Further, in November 1995, Herbert Smith with counsel's assistance actually amended their pleadings in the 1994 action to allege expressly that both the BCS and the Consolidator invoices had been prepared to mislead bankers. The considerations expressed in paragraphs 47 and 48 of Mr Bakes's statement could not explain why, as suggested in paragraph 49, Herbert Smith's approach was not materially affected even in later 1995 and early 1996 or why no claim to avoid any of the insurances was then made.\u000a
p1313
aVBesides which tactically the right thing to do is to await the outcome of the fraud action,\u000a
p1314
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p1315
aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aVIn January and February 1996 amended and re-amended points of counterclaim in the 1994 action first introduced and then developed Royal Hotel's assertions of breaches of the two policies as independent claims: see paragraph 38. The reamendment for which I gave leave at the outset of the trial added a specific claim for bank charges and interest as damages for breach of the agreement to pay 1 million under the material damage policy. The action was fought on that basis, and I held that insurers were in breach of a contract made by their loss adjusters on their behalf whereby it had been agreed to make an interim payment of 1,000,000 to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach. In practice, this assessment has not been pursued, quite possibly because the award of interest in the material damage arbitration covered the same period.

If that policy had been avoided, the agreement by the loss adjusters to make the interim payment would have been vulnerable.

p1319
aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a
p1320
aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all.

This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

Balcombe L.J., with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that, even if the demand had preceded the proceedings which led to the judgments of 16th January 1996, still the causes of action thereby created would not have been so clearly part of the subject matter of those actions that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow a new action to be started in respect of them. He went on that the fact that there were no causes of action at all until 25th February 1986 made the matter even clearer, since:\u000a

aVHerbert Smith have for several decades been regularly engaged by Royal Insurance to handle most of their large and high profile claims, as well as policy interpretation and litigious matters. The relationship is one of closeness and considerable confidence, in which Royal Hotel looked to Herbert Smith when they wanted the highest quality of legal assistance. Royal Insurance, which instructed Herbert Smith on behalf of both itself and ICCI, thus relied upon Herbert Smith to look after the interests of insurers during the arbitrations and the preparation for the 1994 trial and, as Mr Carter confirmed, to make judgments that required to be made during their course. Before me, Herbert Smith's state of mind and handling of both the arbitrations and the 1994 action have been treated for all purposes as synonymous with insurers'. No suggestion has been made that any knowledge which may have been possessed or decision which may have been taken by Herbert Smith was not or should not be attributed for any relevant purposes to both ICCI and Royal Insurance. This is relevant, since Herbert Smith at some points conducted matters without specific reference back to insurers.\u000a

aV 1969 2 Q.B. 507, (where it did not matter whether the agreement was void or voidable and the majority judgments are open to different interpretations). I am inclined to think that the agreement to make the interim payment would have fallen away automatically with avoidance of the material damage policy. On this limited basis and more generally because the 1994 action was, to outward appearances, conducted throughout in terms which assumed the existence and validity of the material damage policy, it seems to me that, whatever was intended, insurers' conduct of the 1994 action is also capable of constituting an unequivocal representation as to the validity of the material damage policy.\u000a

aVI need say relatively little about the further step which Miss Bucknall sought to plead as affirmation, the consent order dated 24th July 1996. Mr Veeder resisted its admission into the action on the grounds that it was far too late, incomprehensible and, so far as it could be understood, hopeless. The order dated 24th July 1996 discharged paragraph 4 of a previous order dated 28th July 1994. That order dated 28th July 1994 had by paragraph 3 restrained Royal Hotel from enforcing the material damage award as to 950,000 (of its total of nearly 5 million) until trial of the 1994 action or further order. By paragraph 4 it had ordered insurers to pay 950,000 into an account in the parties' solicitors' joint names. The conceptual basis of this order is not, I think, free from doubt. The general idea was that since Royal Hotel had received 950,000 on account under the business interruption policy, they should not receive the full amount of the material damage award pending the outcome of the 1994 action. What in law was the basis for or effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is less clear. It was apparently accepted that the 950,000 (allegedly) paid and recoverable in respect of the business interruption policy could not be set off in extinction of the undisputed debt on the material damage award. But, if the full amount of the material damage award had had to be paid over, insurers might have obtained Mareva relief in relation to the 950,000 being reclaimed on the business interruption policy. The order, on whatever basis, short-circuited matters.  In early 1996, by way of variation of the order, 475,000 was allowed to be paid out of the joint bank account. Paragraph 4 was discharged by the order dated 24th July 1996, which ordered the balance remaining in the joint account (some 571,000 by that date) to be paid out to insurers in part satisfaction \u000a

aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a
p1326
aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p1327
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1328
aVOn 25th March 1994 Sir Patrick Neill Q.C. issued his first interim award in the material damage arbitration. Insurers' application for leave to appeal was dismissed by Longmore J. on 10th June 1994. Insurers then made a payment to Royal Hotel in respect of the material damage award on 21st June 1994, obtaining an order on 28th July 1994 that involved payment of 950,000 into a joint account pending trial of the 1994 action. Royal Hotel's solicitors sought from Sir Patrick a second interim award for costs of the material damage arbitration, which they submitted should follow the event. After letters from them and Sir Patrick, Herbert Smith responded on 12th October 1994:\u000a
p1329
aVOn 7th November 1995 Royal Hotel's solicitors sent Herbert Smith a detailed summary of costs and disbursements in the material damage arbitration seeking to reach agreement without need for taxation. On 22nd November 1995 Herbert Smith requested copy invoices relating to experts' and counsels' fees and other matters to enable them to consider the disbursements claimed in more detail, and these were then sent. After further pressure from Royal Hotel's solicitors to agree costs with a 10% discount against the sums claimed (failing which such solicitors threatened an application to vary the order relating to the 950,000), Herbert Smith wrote on 22nd December 1995 that they were seeking instructions and that Royal Hotel's time limit of 29th December 1995 was unreasonable, and again on 22nd December, after taking instructions, that Royal Hotel's offer was unacceptable. A letter from Herbert Smith to Royal Insurance of the same date recorded that the thinking behind this was, first, that insurers had good prospects of a better discount on taxation, secondly, that agreement on costs might simply provide Royal Hotel with a fighting fund for the impending trial of the fraud (i.e. 1994) action and, thirdly, that\u000a
p1330
aVThe difference is the more striking, when one looks back at the affidavit of Mr Bakes sworn 27th September 1996 in relation to an application by insurers for summary judgment in the present action. To that affidavit Mr Bakes first produced his copy of the particulars annotated Moral hazard. He recalled the discussion with Mr Higgins and Ms Kydd in November 1994, and said that they had been concerned about the reliability of the information produced by Royal Hotel and had concluded (a) that they would only have all the relevant facts after judgment in the 1994 action and (b) that the right course would be to wait until then before deciding whether or not to assert non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy,  The affidavit continued:\u000a
p1331
aVMr Bakes's witness statement made no reference at all to any significance which moral hazard might have had in terms of the business interruption policy, under which insurers were already seeking to forfeit all benefit on the grounds of fraudulent claim, or to any discussion in that regard. On any objective view, any moral hazard represented by dishonest preparation of invoices to mislead bankers about the hotel's trading would have been more directly material to the business interruption policy than to a material damage policy. Mr Bakes's affidavit sworn in the Order 14 application is of interest in confirming what one would expect, namely that avoidance of the business interruption policy on this ground was considered in November 1994. But its suggestion that the partners in Herbert Smith then decided that we were not in a position to amend the pleadings in the 1994 action, in relation to the business interruption policy cannot be correct. Mr Bakes, when recalled to give evidence about the thinking in November 1994 with regard to the business interruption policy, suggested that they did not focus on that policy because we were already engaged in the fraud proceedings which related to that policy. But an additional way of justifying an existing avoidance of liability would be something on which one would have expected them to focus, rather than not to focus.  The key to Herbert Smith's thinking is in my view probably to be found in later answers by Mr Bakes, in which he accepted that part of the thinking was that they really had good enough defences - a good, clear argument - to be happy to go to trial on the business interruption policy, without developing a variant. In theory, a case based on non-disclosure would have offered a more direct route to avoidance of all liability. But it would obviously have lacked the compelling forensic attraction of the existing defence based on fraud in the presentation of the very insurance claim which Royal Hotel was pursuing. It is the sort of alternative defence which legal advisers might prefer not to be seeking to introduce by way \u000a
p1332
aV has no application to a situation where there was no avoidance and no right to reclaim sums paid under the material damage policy until 12th August 1996. It was however delivered in a case where there was no real connection between the subject-matters of the different proceedings. Further, the position of a person who may, if and when he chooses to make a demand, acquire a cause of action in debt or for damages is not necessarily analogous for present purposes to that of a party to a voidable contract with a right to avoid. The former may make such a demand at any time. The latter is anyway subject to certain restrictions, arising from the possibility of affirmation as well as promissory estoppel.\u000a
p1333
aVIn my judgment, the principle extended in this way in potentially applicable in the present context. Reliance was placed on the material damage policy in the counterclaims made by Royal Hotel against insurers in the 1994 action. Insurers met that reliance by accepting the existence of the material damage policy, but by denying any liability, whether for conspiracy or for breach, in respect of it. In one area, albeit minor, insurers lost on the case made against them of breach. The effect of their present case would be to undermine that conclusion, as well as to enable them to recover the sums paid under the material damage policy, which they could on the face of it also have counterclaimed to the counterclaim in the 1994 action. How the 1994 action would then have proceeded is a matter which cannot of course now be known for certain; but it would probably have been considered on the application for a split trial with which I in fact dealt with on 9th December 1994, as outlined on page 98 of my previous judgment, or at a later stage if the issue had been raised later.\u000a
p1334
aVThere is in the circumstances no doubt that the issue of non-disclosure and avoidance could with reasonable diligence have been brought forward in the 1994 action. Was it one which properly belonged to the previous action? And, if it did, are there special circumstances which should lead to the non-application of the wider rule in \u000a
p1335
aVIn the previous action, I considered claims by ICCI and Royal Insurance and counterclaims by Royal Hotel arising out of the fires and the conduct of the potential claims to which they gave rise. I held that Royal Hotel had forfeited all benefit under the business interruption policy and was obliged to repay the 950,000 received under that policy on account of claims arising out of the fires of June 1992. The basis was that, following the fires, Mr McHugh on behalf of Royal Hotel had on a number of occasions used fraudulent means or devices to promote Royal Hotel's position and to obtain benefits under the business interruption policy, and that condition 5 of that policy provided for forfeiture of all such benefit in such circumstances. The counterclaims were for alleged conspiracy and/or breach of contract in relation to both the business interruption and the material damage policies. I dismissed them, with the limited exception that I held that ICCI was as from 31st December 1992 in breach of a contract whereby it had agreed to pay Royal Hotel an interim payment of 1,000,000 in respect of the material damage policy. I ordered damages to be assessed in respect of that breach.\u000a
p1336
aV into the field of exercise of substantive rights. Such an extension in the particular context of voidability of insurance contracts appears to me to reflect the commercial and practical realities which apply between parties to litigation such as the 1994 action, where the insurance contracts had no continuing significance save in respect of claims already paid or being pursued under them. I note, in passing, that in \u000a

aVThe Plaintiffs' claims relate to four separate but interrelated transactions. It is unnecessary to describe these transactions in detail. In outline they were as follows:\u000a
p1338
aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1339
aVAn extremely complex cover up scheme is alleged to have been set up to conceal the true nature of this arrangement. It is unnecessary to say more than that again the 'loans' or 'transactions' are said to be sham. Since the hearing before Mance J. the Plaintiffs claim to have traced US $105 million of the Pincinco money to an account owned and controlled by Mr de la Rosa.\u000a
p1340
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a
p1341
aVThe proceedings before Mance J. lasted 25 days and led to a judgment extending to 174 pages in which the Judge carefully went through the points which had been argued before him. Much of the time was taken up by submissions on behalf of the Defendants that there were no serious issues to be tried. Save in respect of the claim of Torras London in the Wardbase transaction, where the Judge held that Torras London had no arguable claim to have been the victim of a conspiracy or to have suffered loss, he rejected those submissions. We find it difficult to see how it could properly have been argued at such length that there was no serious issue to be tried: (See \u000a
p1342
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action. The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1343
aV Knox J drew a distinction between validity and propriety. He was concerned with an action in which it was alleged that officers of the company had acted in excess of their powers (i) because they had acted without the authority of a properly convened and quorate board meeting and (ii) because the transaction to which they had committed the company was so detrimental to the interests of the company that no reasonable board of directors could properly have assented to it. Knox J held that the first of these issues fell within Article 16 (2) but that the second did not. We agree with him that the first issue plainly fell within the scope of the Article, but we should wish to reserve for future consideration the correctness of his decision that the second did not. The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company. Allegations of the kind made in \u000a
p1344
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a
p1345
aVThe Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, or those of them who were in a position to do so assisted by the others, misappropriated enormous sums of the Plaintiffs' money by procuring sums to be paid into offshore bank accounts set up to disguise the identity of the recipients, without the Plaintiffs receiving any benefit from the payments, and that they arranged for the true nature of the transactions to be concealed from the Plaintiffs and their auditors by a series of complicated but sham accounting transactions. As a result of interlocutory proceedings, the destination of some of the money has been identified. Very large sums have found their way to the First, Third and Fifth Defendants or offshore companies controlled by them, and substantial sums have been expended by them on maintaining luxurious lifestyles or funding private business enterprises of their own.\u000a
p1346
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1347
aV (1882) 21 Ch.D. 292 but is inherently absurd. The provision of loan capital and its conversion into share capital are self-contained commercial transactions in which the company gives and receives value. By themselves they are incapable of mitigating or avoiding the loss which the company sustained by the theft of its funds.\u000a
p1348
aV(b) if they had done, I would have been prepared to allow Grupo Torras to make a reservation in respect of the four transactions in the Spanish criminal proceedings;\u000a
p1349
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies. The personal Defendants are officers of or professional advisers to the Plaintiff companies; they are said to have engineered or facilitated the frauds. The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds. All but one of the Defendants (the Fourth Defendant, Walid Edmond Moukarzel) challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, seeking to set aside or stay the proceedings under RSC Order 12, rule 8 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The central question is where should the Plaintiffs' claims be tried, in England, as the Plaintiffs contend, or in Spain, as the Defendants contend. Mr Justice Mance rejected the challenge of all the Defendants, save in the case of the claim of Grupo Torras against Coll & Company Ltd. where the proceedings have been stayed pursuant to an arbitration clause. Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a

aVSecondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline, or at the least defer, jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized. At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in \u000a
p1356
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement.

The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1357
aVThe third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions, that is to say, actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action. This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a
p1358
aVThe length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days. The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject (subject to an immaterial qualification) the applications of the Defendants. He held that Article 16(2) did not apply. He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a

p1360
aV(3)  That the Court should stay the action under Article 22.\u000a

aV(4)  That, if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21, or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 16(2) or 22, the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under O.li, or should stay, the remainder of the action.\u000a
p1362
aVThe Article 16(2) point is free-standing. The Article 21 and 22 points are inter-related as they both raise the question whether the English court was the court first seized. This is a question partly of European law (the Convention), partly of English procedural law (when was the English court seized of the action?) and partly a question of fact when under Spanish procedural law the Spanish courts became seized of the proceedings before them.\u000a
p1363
aV. This submission is far too wide. Whether an action falls within Article 16(2) depends upon its subject matter - the nature of the dispute - not upon the relationship between the parties. A claim by an officer of a company for wrongful dismissal, for example, does not fall within the Article, though a claim that the decision to dismiss him had been taken by a meeting of the board which was inquorate would do so.\u000a

Very large sums have found their way to the First, Third and Fifth Defendants or offshore companies controlled by them, and substantial sums have been expended by them on maintaining luxurious lifestyles or funding private business enterprises of their own.\u000a
p1367
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1368
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1369
aV (1882) 21 Ch.D. 292 but is inherently absurd. The provision of loan capital and its conversion into share capital are self-contained commercial transactions in which the company gives and receives value. By themselves they are incapable of mitigating or avoiding the loss which the company sustained by the theft of its funds.\u000a
p1370
aVThe subject matter of this action remains the frauds which it is alleged that the Defendants have practised on the Plaintiff companies. The object of these proceedings is not decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras (nor, for that matter, of Torras London).\u000a
p1371
aVAccordingly, even on the construction of Article 16(2) contended for by the Defendants, the present proceedings clearly fall outside it. Article 16(2} does not debar the English courts from assuming jurisdiction in respect of the present action.\u000a
p1372
aV21. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\u000a
p1373
aV22. Where related actions are brought in the courtB of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised may, while the actions are pending at first instance, stay its proceedings.\u000a
p1374
aVA court other than the court first Eeised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the law of that court permits the consolidation of related actions and the court first seised has jurisdiction over both actions.\u000a
p1375
aVFor the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the riek of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\u000a
p1376
aVAs previously stated, the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized, it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions, this action in England and the criminal, guerelJa, proceedings and the Quail action in Spain.\u000a
p1377
aVQuestions of foreign law are questions of fact which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Judge. If the evidence of expert witnesses conflicts, it is the Judge's duty to resolve these differences in the same way as he must in the case of other conflicting evidence of fact: (\u000a
p1378
aV. His decision on the question whether, for the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings were between the same parties was therefore, on any view, reached on the wrong basis and must be reconsidered. He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.\u000a
p1379
aV(iii) it follows from conclusion (ii) that there is no basis for applying Article 21 or 23 since the present action was the first action definitively pending;\u000a
p1380
aV(iv) the Spanish civil proceedings are not between the same parties (or, if this be the test, between substantially the same parties) as the present English action within the meaning of Article 21 - this follows from my general conclusion that the two sets of proceedings should be compared overall;\u000a
p1381
aV(v) (a) the Spanish civil proceedings do not involve the same (or substantially the same) cause of action as the present English action;\u000a
p1382
aV(b) if they had done, I would have been prepared to allow Grupo Torras to make a reservation in respect of the four transactions in the Spanish criminal proceedings;\u000a
p1383
aVIt is accepted that his reason under (iv) cannot stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras, Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies.\u000a
p1384
aVIn relation to the Quail action he said at p.124);\u000a
p1385
aV(iii) both such dates post-date the English court's definitive seizure of the present action on 15th April 1993, applying the view which I take of definitive seizure under English law;\u000a
p1386
aV(iv) Neither the original nor the amended Quail proceedings is between the same or (substantially the same) parties as the present action - again this follows from my conclusion that the two sets of proceedings fall to be compared overall;\u000a
p1387
aV(v) on an overall comparison .... there is no identity of causes of action .... if it were right to look solely at the position as between GT and the co-plaintiffs to the amended \u000a
p1388
aV proceedings, the amended Quail proceedings would in this respect involve the same cause of action between the game parties.\u000a
p1389
aVIt is thus the amended Quail proceedings that are directly relevant. As Mance J has held, they are to a certain extent between the same parties and involve the same cause of action. The critical question therefore becomes which court was first seized.\u000a
p1390
aVTitle II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction. This is a necessary corollary of Title III. In particular, provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments. Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State. Under Article 6, a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State (para.l); third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted (paras.2&3}. It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments, either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense. These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8, which is headed: \u000a
p1391
aV - related actions.\u000a
p1392
aVWhilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same, the subject matter of the two articles is different. Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; Article 22 applies to related actions, that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 27.3. This relationship was emphasised in \u000a
p1393
aV. In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made, supported by the Advocate-General, that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22, for instance, the moment the proceedings were served. The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continued:\u000a
p1394
aV, therefore, it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties, as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action, a concept which is peculiar to German law and which, because of its characteristics, cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned.\u000a
p1395
aV14. It may properly be inferred from Article 21, read as a whole, that a court's obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. Beyond that, Article 21 gives no indication of the nature of the procedural formalities which must be taken into account for the purposes of considering whether or not to recognise the existence of such an effect. In particular, it gives no indication as to the answer to the question whether a \u000a
p1396
aV15. Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law. That method allows each court to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty, by reference to its own national law, as regards itself, and by reference to the national law of any other court which has been seised, as regards that court, the order or priority in time of several actions brought within the conditions laid down by the Convention.\u000a
p1397
aVThus the Court declined the invitation to lay down any particular time at which any action would become pending. In the final sentence of paragraph 14, the Court accepted that the Convention does not preclude the possibility that the receipt by a court of an application may be the moment at which a \u000a
p1398
aV judgment expressly recognises that a court considering an .Article 21 or 22 question will have not only to consider the pendency of the action before it under its own national law but also the pendency under the national laws of other States of any relevant actions pending before the courts of the other States, (para.15) Thus it recognises that the courts of one State will have to reach a decision regarding the pendency of an action before the courts of another State notwithstanding that the question involves the national law of that other State.\u000a
p1399
aV tl994 2 Lloyds 6, the Court of Appeal has held that in English procedural law an action becomes definitively pending upon the service of the writ, not upon its mere issue. This is authority binding upon us, as it was on Mance J, that the present action was not definitively pending - that the English court was not seized of this action - until the writ had been served.\u000a
p1400
aV (406/92), delivered on 6th December 1994, no judgment had had to address the question of multiple parties. That case concerned the carriage on the vessel, the Tatry, of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated, it was said, by diesel oil. Various actions and cross-actions, \u000a
p1401
aV, were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England. The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions; one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied. The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together. The Court held:\u000a
p1402
aV33. In the light of the wording of Article 21 of the Convention and the objective set out above, that article must be understood as requiring, as a condition of the obligation of the second court seised to decline jurisdiction, that the parties to the two actions be identical.\u000a
p1403
aV34. Consequently, where some of the parties are the same as the parties to an action which has already been started, Article 21 requires the second court seised to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings pending before it are also parties to the action previously started before the court of another Contracting state; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1404
aV35. Admittedly, that interpretation of Article 21 involves fragmenting the proceedings. However, Article 22 mitigates that disadvantage. That article allows the second court seised to stay proceedings or to decline jurisdiction on the ground that the actions are related, if the conditions there set out are satisfied.\u000a
p1405
aV36. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that, on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention, where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State, the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1406
aVThus the Court held that a party by party approach must be adopted: to the extent that any of the parties in the relevant actions are the same, then Article 21 applies to those actions insofar as those actions are between those parties and not otherwise. The Court also recognised that this has the result that litigation may become fragmented. A court may have to decline jurisdiction as between some parties but allow the action to continue as between others. An Article 22 question will then almost certainly arise and have to be addressed by the court (or courts) to which that article applies.\u000a
p1407
aVone is asking about. The logical force of this submission is compelling and it is clearly supported by the authorities. The Respondents on the other hand argued for a more pragmatic approach. They pointed out that part of the purpose of the Convention was the simplification of procedures. They argued that .Articles 22 and 21 should be construed together and that the court should always ask itself as a threshold question which court was first seized; it is only after that question has been answered that the court second seized need consider under .Article 21 the extent to which the action before it involves the same cause of action and is between the same parties. Hence, they argue that the relevant date for Article 21 (and Article 22) is the first date upon which it can be said that any defendant has been served.\u000a
p1408
aVForensically, each advocate sought to extend his argument from one of the articles, 21 or 22, to the other. The Respondents' argument had obvious force where the question is which of the two courts was first seized of one of the related actions to which Article 22 applies; they then, with less conviction and little loyalty to \u000a
p1409
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1410
aVThe interpretation 'which best matches the context and purpose of the Convention' is in my judgment one which gives a single date of definitive pendency for each action by taking the date of first service on any defendant in a case of multiple defendants.\u000a
p1411
aV, the arguments of the Respondents before us are substantially to the same effect and would, if accepted, lead to the same conclusion. The Respondents, relying upon the arguments to which we have referred, submitted that the date upon which the English court became seized of the present action was still, for the purposes of Article 21, 15th April 1993, the date upon which the first batch of Defendants were served. But it is not necessary for us to rule upon this submission since in our judgment the English court was the first seized whether the 15th April is the correct date or some later date down to the end of June by which time, on either side's submissions, all the relevant Defendants save Mr. Nunez had been served with the English writ.\u000a
p1412
aVFor the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings which are relevant are, in England, the present action and, in Spain, the 'Quail' proceedings. (We will leave on one side for the time being the criminal proceedings; we consider that the Judge was clearly correct in his conclusion that they could not assist the Defendant's case on Article 21.) After the amendment of the Quail action, the parties who are common to the English action and to the amended Quail action are Grupo Torras and messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler. It is accepted for present purposes that the causes of action as between these parties are the same in the two actions. Approaching the matter on a party by party basis, as contended for by the Appellants, and applying \u000a
p1413
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a
p1414
aV(1) The Spanish courts became seized on 9th June 1992 because once the Quail proceedings had been amended (on 18th May 1993) the amendment related back under Spanish procedural law to the original date of filing and the date of filing is the date upon which a Spanish court becomes under Spanish procedural law seized of an action. This way of putting their case would, if accepted, also make the Article 21 interpretation dispute academic; 9th June 1992 precedes any possible date for the English proceedings.\u000a
p1415
aVThe Judge's finding that admission was the critical date for civil proceedings was contrary to the views of both side's experts. It has been submitted to us that he failed to make a necessary distinction between what was involved in the admission of ordinary civil proceedings (like the Quail action) and the admission of criminal proceedings started by \u000a
p1416
aVIt was accepted before us that the effect of the expert evidence was that in ordinary civil proceedings the step of admission was a purely administrative exercise, checking the documents filed by the plaintiff to see that they comply with the formal requirements and are complete. Unlike the position in the procedural law governing Spanish criminal proceedings, admission does not involve any decision by the court or any determination that the court seize itself of the proceedings. Put at its highest, it is merely the stage at which the papers are accepted as fit for service. Therefore we accept the primary submission of both parties that, on the evidence, the date of admission cannot be taken as the date on which the Spanish court became seized of the Quail or amended Quail action.\u000a
p1417
aVIf admission is not to be adopted as the stage at which the Spanish civil court is to be treated as seized of the action for the purposes of the Convention, the choice lies between the date of filing and the date of service. In our judgment, the choice does not depend upon determining any contentious question of Spanish law: the difference between the parties depends upon how the question ought to be approached as a matter of the implementation of the Convention.\u000a
p1418
aV has the character of a procedural defence. Its validity is determined upon a basis of priority. The prior action has the status of being pending; it is treated as being the 'master' and the second action must defer to it. The exception of \u000a
p1419
aV having been raised in the second action and upheld, the judge has -various procedural powers to ensure that the relevant matters are all determined in the first action. It was the view of the Spanish witnesses, at least on the Defendants' side, that Article 21 of the Convention was an implementation of the same principle of procedural law.\u000a
p1420
aVThe Defendants' expert accordingly reasoned that the application of Article 21 simply involved the application of the domestic Spanish law and asking what date would the Spanish court take for the purpose of assessing the priority to be given to the Quail action if an exception of \u000a
p1421
aV was raised in it by Grupo Torras. They said that the Spanish court would take the date of the issue of the proceedings. They have the clearest support for this view of the domestic Spanish law. In October 1992 the Supreme Court of Spain (civil appeal No.7557) had to decide which of two actions should be treated as the prior. One action had been filed first but the proceedings were not served until after the proceedings in the other had been both filed and served. The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of \u000a
p1422
aV could not be raised in that action.\u000a
p1423
aVHowever it is also clear, and it is accepted by the Appellants before us, that the exception cannot be taken until the proceedings in the action alleged to be the pending action (the \u000a
p1424
aVOn the findings which the Appellants accept, it is clear that the requirements of Spanish law for an action to become definitively pending are that it has been filed, accepted and served. Until all those requirements have been met, it cannot be relied upon as a - \u000a
p1425
aV confines the role of the domestic law to answering the question when were the requirements of that law for the action to have become definitively pending first fulfilled. It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993, that is to say, a date after the date upon which the English court had, on any view, became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties, which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them.\u000a
p1426
aV had been properly raised, Spanish law treated the action as having been pending since the time of filing. There was evidence to support both these submissions as a matter of Spanish law. But they still did not advance the Appellants' case under the Convention. The test laid down in \u000a
p1427
aV test at any of the earlier stages. It may be impossible to say definitively who are going to be the parties and what are going to be the causes of action. .All these difficulties applied in the present case. But the Appellants had a further difficulty. As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted. It was not until February 1994 that they were finally admitted by an appellate court. (Currently the investigating judge is still carrying out his investigations.) Unless the Appellants can rely upon some principle of relation back, they on any view cannot succeed on this ground of appeal. But as is clearly stated in \u000a
p1428
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1429
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action. The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1430
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a
p1431
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies. The personal Defendants are officers of or professional advisers to the Plaintiff companies; they are said to have engineered or facilitated the frauds. The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds. All but one of the Defendants (the Fourth Defendant, Walid Edmond Moukarzel) challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, seeking to set aside or stay the proceedings under RSC Order 12, rule 8 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The central question is where should the Plaintiffs' claims be tried, in England, as the Plaintiffs contend, or in Spain, as the Defendants contend. Mr Justice Mance rejected the challenge of all the Defendants, save in the case of the claim of Grupo Torras against Coll & Company Ltd. where the proceedings have been stayed pursuant to an arbitration clause. Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a
p1432
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a
p1433
aV15. Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law. That method allows each court to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty, by reference to its own national law, as regards itself, and by reference to the national law of any other court which has been seised, as regards that court, the order or priority in time of several actions brought within the conditions laid down by the Convention.\u000a
p1434
aVThe Article 16(2) point is free-standing. The Article 21 and 22 points are inter-related as they both raise the question whether the English court was the court first seized. This is a question partly of European law (the Convention), partly of English procedural law (when was the English court seized of the action?) and partly a question of fact when under Spanish procedural law the Spanish courts became seized of the proceedings before them.\u000a
p1435
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1436
aVQuestions of foreign law are questions of fact which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Judge. If the evidence of expert witnesses conflicts, it is the Judge's duty to resolve these differences in the same way as he must in the case of other conflicting evidence of fact: (\u000a
p1437
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies. The personal Defendants are officers of or professional advisers to the Plaintiff companies; they are said to have engineered or facilitated the frauds. The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds. All but one of the Defendants (the Fourth Defendant, Walid Edmond Moukarzel) challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, seeking to set aside or stay the proceedings under RSC Order 12, rule 8 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The central question is where should the Plaintiffs' claims be tried, in England, as the Plaintiffs contend, or in Spain, as the Defendants contend. Mr Justice Mance rejected the challenge of all the Defendants, save in the case of the claim of Grupo Torras against Coll & Company Ltd. where the proceedings have been stayed pursuant to an arbitration clause. Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a
p1438
aVThe Plaintiffs' claims relate to four separate but interrelated transactions. It is unnecessary to describe these transactions in detail. In outline they were as follows:\u000a
p1439
aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1440
aVAn extremely complex cover up scheme is alleged to have been set up to conceal the true nature of this arrangement. It is unnecessary to say more than that again the 'loans' or 'transactions' are said to be sham. Since the hearing before Mance J. the Plaintiffs claim to have traced US $105 million of the Pincinco money to an account owned and controlled by Mr de la Rosa.\u000a
p1441
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a
p1442
aVThe proceedings before Mance J. lasted 25 days and led to a judgment extending to 174 pages in which the Judge carefully went through the points which had been argued before him. Much of the time was taken up by submissions on behalf of the Defendants that there were no serious issues to be tried. Save in respect of the claim of Torras London in the Wardbase transaction, where the Judge held that Torras London had no arguable claim to have been the victim of a conspiracy or to have suffered loss, he rejected those submissions. We find it difficult to see how it could properly have been argued at such length that there was no serious issue to be tried: (See \u000a
p1443
aVSecondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline, or at the least defer, jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized. At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in \u000a
p1444
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action. The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1445
aVThe third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions, that is to say, actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action. This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a
p1446
aVThe length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days. The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject (subject to an immaterial qualification) the applications of the Defendants. He held that Article 16(2) did not apply. He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a
p1447
aV(b)  The Quail action.\u000a
p1448
aV(3)  That the Court should stay the action under Article 22.\u000a
p1449
aV(4)  That, if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21, or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 16(2) or 22, the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under O.li, or should stay, the remainder of the action.\u000a
p1450
aVThe Article 16(2) point is free-standing. The Article 21 and 22 points are inter-related as they both raise the question whether the English court was the court first seized. This is a question partly of European law (the Convention), partly of English procedural law (when was the English court seized of the action?) and partly a question of fact when under Spanish procedural law the Spanish courts became seized of the proceedings before them.\u000a
p1451
aV. This submission is far too wide. Whether an action falls within Article 16(2) depends upon its subject matter - the nature of the dispute - not upon the relationship between the parties. A claim by an officer of a company for wrongful dismissal, for example, does not fall within the Article, though a claim that the decision to dismiss him had been taken by a meeting of the board which was inquorate would do so.\u000a
p1452
aV Knox J drew a distinction between validity and propriety. He was concerned with an action in which it was alleged that officers of the company had acted in excess of their powers (i) because they had acted without the authority of a properly convened and quorate board meeting and (ii) because the transaction to which they had committed the company was so detrimental to the interests of the company that no reasonable board of directors could properly have assented to it. Knox J held that the first of these issues fell within Article 16 (2) but that the second did not. We agree with him that the first issue plainly fell within the scope of the Article, but we should wish to reserve for future consideration the correctness of his decision that the second did not. The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company. Allegations of the kind made in \u000a
p1453
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a
p1454
aVThe Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, or those of them who were in a position to do so assisted by the others, misappropriated enormous sums of the Plaintiffs' money by procuring sums to be paid into offshore bank accounts set up to disguise the identity of the recipients, without the Plaintiffs receiving any benefit from the payments, and that they arranged for the true nature of the transactions to be concealed from the Plaintiffs and their auditors by a series of complicated but sham accounting transactions. As a result of interlocutory proceedings, the destination of some of the money has been identified. Very large sums have found their way to the First, Third and Fifth Defendants or offshore companies controlled by them, and substantial sums have been expended by them on maintaining luxurious lifestyles or funding private business enterprises of their own.\u000a
p1455
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1456
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1457
aV (1882) 21 Ch.D. 292 but is inherently absurd. The provision of loan capital and its conversion into share capital are self-contained commercial transactions in which the company gives and receives value. By themselves they are incapable of mitigating or avoiding the loss which the company sustained by the theft of its funds.\u000a
p1458
aVThe subject matter of this action remains the frauds which it is alleged that the Defendants have practised on the Plaintiff companies. The object of these proceedings is not decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras (nor, for that matter, of Torras London).\u000a
p1459
aVAccordingly, even on the construction of Article 16(2) contended for by the Defendants, the present proceedings clearly fall outside it. Article 16(2} does not debar the English courts from assuming jurisdiction in respect of the present action.\u000a
p1460
aV21. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\u000a
p1461
aV22. Where related actions are brought in the courtB of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised may, while the actions are pending at first instance, stay its proceedings.\u000a
p1462
aVA court other than the court first Eeised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the law of that court permits the consolidation of related actions and the court first seised has jurisdiction over both actions.\u000a
p1463
aVFor the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the riek of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\u000a
p1464
aVAs previously stated, the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized, it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions, this action in England and the criminal, guerelJa, proceedings and the Quail action in Spain.\u000a
p1465
aVQuestions of foreign law are questions of fact which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Judge. If the evidence of expert witnesses conflicts, it is the Judge's duty to resolve these differences in the same way as he must in the case of other conflicting evidence of fact: (\u000a
p1466
aV. His decision on the question whether, for the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings were between the same parties was therefore, on any view, reached on the wrong basis and must be reconsidered. He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.\u000a
p1467
aV(iii) it follows from conclusion (ii) that there is no basis for applying Article 21 or 23 since the present action was the first action definitively pending;\u000a
p1468
aV(iv) the Spanish civil proceedings are not between the same parties (or, if this be the test, between substantially the same parties) as the present English action within the meaning of Article 21 - this follows from my general conclusion that the two sets of proceedings should be compared overall;\u000a
p1469
aV(v) (a) the Spanish civil proceedings do not involve the same (or substantially the same) cause of action as the present English action;\u000a
p1470
aV(b) if they had done, I would have been prepared to allow Grupo Torras to make a reservation in respect of the four transactions in the Spanish criminal proceedings;\u000a
p1471
aVIt is accepted that his reason under (iv) cannot stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras, Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies.\u000a
p1472
aVIn relation to the Quail action he said at p.124);\u000a
p1473
aV(iii) both such dates post-date the English court's definitive seizure of the present action on 15th April 1993, applying the view which I take of definitive seizure under English law;\u000a
p1474
aV(iv) Neither the original nor the amended Quail proceedings is between the same or (substantially the same) parties as the present action - again this follows from my conclusion that the two sets of proceedings fall to be compared overall;\u000a
p1475
aV(v) on an overall comparison .... there is no identity of causes of action .... if it were right to look solely at the position as between GT and the co-plaintiffs to the amended \u000a
p1476
aV proceedings, the amended Quail proceedings would in this respect involve the same cause of action between the game parties.\u000a
p1477
aVIt is thus the amended Quail proceedings that are directly relevant. As Mance J has held, they are to a certain extent between the same parties and involve the same cause of action. The critical question therefore becomes which court was first seized.\u000a
p1478
aVTitle II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction. This is a necessary corollary of Title III. In particular, provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments. Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State. Under Article 6, a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State (para.l); third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted (paras.2&3}. It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments, either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense. These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8, which is headed: \u000a
p1479
aV - related actions.\u000a
p1480
aVWhilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same, the subject matter of the two articles is different. Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; Article 22 applies to related actions, that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 27.3. This relationship was emphasised in \u000a
p1481
aV. In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made, supported by the Advocate-General, that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22, for instance, the moment the proceedings were served. The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continued:\u000a
p1482
aV, therefore, it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties, as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action, a concept which is peculiar to German law and which, because of its characteristics, cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned.\u000a
p1483
aV14. It may properly be inferred from Article 21, read as a whole, that a court's obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. Beyond that, Article 21 gives no indication of the nature of the procedural formalities which must be taken into account for the purposes of considering whether or not to recognise the existence of such an effect. In particular, it gives no indication as to the answer to the question whether a \u000a
p1484
aV15. Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law. That method allows each court to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty, by reference to its own national law, as regards itself, and by reference to the national law of any other court which has been seised, as regards that court, the order or priority in time of several actions brought within the conditions laid down by the Convention.\u000a
p1485
aVThus the Court declined the invitation to lay down any particular time at which any action would become pending. In the final sentence of paragraph 14, the Court accepted that the Convention does not preclude the possibility that the receipt by a court of an application may be the moment at which a \u000a
p1486
aV judgment expressly recognises that a court considering an .Article 21 or 22 question will have not only to consider the pendency of the action before it under its own national law but also the pendency under the national laws of other States of any relevant actions pending before the courts of the other States, (para.15) Thus it recognises that the courts of one State will have to reach a decision regarding the pendency of an action before the courts of another State notwithstanding that the question involves the national law of that other State.\u000a
p1487
aV tl994 2 Lloyds 6, the Court of Appeal has held that in English procedural law an action becomes definitively pending upon the service of the writ, not upon its mere issue. This is authority binding upon us, as it was on Mance J, that the present action was not definitively pending - that the English court was not seized of this action - until the writ had been served.\u000a
p1488
aV (406/92), delivered on 6th December 1994, no judgment had had to address the question of multiple parties. That case concerned the carriage on the vessel, the Tatry, of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated, it was said, by diesel oil. Various actions and cross-actions, \u000a
p1489
aV, were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England. The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions; one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied. The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together. The Court held:\u000a
p1490
aV33. In the light of the wording of Article 21 of the Convention and the objective set out above, that article must be understood as requiring, as a condition of the obligation of the second court seised to decline jurisdiction, that the parties to the two actions be identical.\u000a
p1491
aV34. Consequently, where some of the parties are the same as the parties to an action which has already been started, Article 21 requires the second court seised to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings pending before it are also parties to the action previously started before the court of another Contracting state; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1492
aV35. Admittedly, that interpretation of Article 21 involves fragmenting the proceedings. However, Article 22 mitigates that disadvantage. That article allows the second court seised to stay proceedings or to decline jurisdiction on the ground that the actions are related, if the conditions there set out are satisfied.\u000a
p1493
aV36. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that, on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention, where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State, the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1494
aVThus the Court held that a party by party approach must be adopted: to the extent that any of the parties in the relevant actions are the same, then Article 21 applies to those actions insofar as those actions are between those parties and not otherwise. The Court also recognised that this has the result that litigation may become fragmented. A court may have to decline jurisdiction as between some parties but allow the action to continue as between others. An Article 22 question will then almost certainly arise and have to be addressed by the court (or courts) to which that article applies.\u000a
p1495
aVone is asking about. The logical force of this submission is compelling and it is clearly supported by the authorities. The Respondents on the other hand argued for a more pragmatic approach. They pointed out that part of the purpose of the Convention was the simplification of procedures. They argued that .Articles 22 and 21 should be construed together and that the court should always ask itself as a threshold question which court was first seized; it is only after that question has been answered that the court second seized need consider under .Article 21 the extent to which the action before it involves the same cause of action and is between the same parties. Hence, they argue that the relevant date for Article 21 (and Article 22) is the first date upon which it can be said that any defendant has been served.\u000a
p1496
aVForensically, each advocate sought to extend his argument from one of the articles, 21 or 22, to the other. The Respondents' argument had obvious force where the question is which of the two courts was first seized of one of the related actions to which Article 22 applies; they then, with less conviction and little loyalty to \u000a
p1497
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1498
aVThe interpretation 'which best matches the context and purpose of the Convention' is in my judgment one which gives a single date of definitive pendency for each action by taking the date of first service on any defendant in a case of multiple defendants.\u000a
p1499
aV, the arguments of the Respondents before us are substantially to the same effect and would, if accepted, lead to the same conclusion. The Respondents, relying upon the arguments to which we have referred, submitted that the date upon which the English court became seized of the present action was still, for the purposes of Article 21, 15th April 1993, the date upon which the first batch of Defendants were served. But it is not necessary for us to rule upon this submission since in our judgment the English court was the first seized whether the 15th April is the correct date or some later date down to the end of June by which time, on either side's submissions, all the relevant Defendants save Mr. Nunez had been served with the English writ.\u000a
p1500
aVFor the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings which are relevant are, in England, the present action and, in Spain, the 'Quail' proceedings. (We will leave on one side for the time being the criminal proceedings; we consider that the Judge was clearly correct in his conclusion that they could not assist the Defendant's case on Article 21.) After the amendment of the Quail action, the parties who are common to the English action and to the amended Quail action are Grupo Torras and messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler. It is accepted for present purposes that the causes of action as between these parties are the same in the two actions. Approaching the matter on a party by party basis, as contended for by the Appellants, and applying \u000a
p1501
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a
p1502
aV(1) The Spanish courts became seized on 9th June 1992 because once the Quail proceedings had been amended (on 18th May 1993) the amendment related back under Spanish procedural law to the original date of filing and the date of filing is the date upon which a Spanish court becomes under Spanish procedural law seized of an action. This way of putting their case would, if accepted, also make the Article 21 interpretation dispute academic; 9th June 1992 precedes any possible date for the English proceedings.\u000a
p1503
aVThe Judge's finding that admission was the critical date for civil proceedings was contrary to the views of both side's experts. It has been submitted to us that he failed to make a necessary distinction between what was involved in the admission of ordinary civil proceedings (like the Quail action) and the admission of criminal proceedings started by \u000a
p1504
aVIt was accepted before us that the effect of the expert evidence was that in ordinary civil proceedings the step of admission was a purely administrative exercise, checking the documents filed by the plaintiff to see that they comply with the formal requirements and are complete. Unlike the position in the procedural law governing Spanish criminal proceedings, admission does not involve any decision by the court or any determination that the court seize itself of the proceedings. Put at its highest, it is merely the stage at which the papers are accepted as fit for service. Therefore we accept the primary submission of both parties that, on the evidence, the date of admission cannot be taken as the date on which the Spanish court became seized of the Quail or amended Quail action.\u000a
p1505
aVIf admission is not to be adopted as the stage at which the Spanish civil court is to be treated as seized of the action for the purposes of the Convention, the choice lies between the date of filing and the date of service. In our judgment, the choice does not depend upon determining any contentious question of Spanish law: the difference between the parties depends upon how the question ought to be approached as a matter of the implementation of the Convention.\u000a
p1506
aV has the character of a procedural defence. Its validity is determined upon a basis of priority. The prior action has the status of being pending; it is treated as being the 'master' and the second action must defer to it. The exception of \u000a
p1507
aV having been raised in the second action and upheld, the judge has -various procedural powers to ensure that the relevant matters are all determined in the first action. It was the view of the Spanish witnesses, at least on the Defendants' side, that Article 21 of the Convention was an implementation of the same principle of procedural law.\u000a
p1508
aVThe Defendants' expert accordingly reasoned that the application of Article 21 simply involved the application of the domestic Spanish law and asking what date would the Spanish court take for the purpose of assessing the priority to be given to the Quail action if an exception of \u000a
p1509
aV was raised in it by Grupo Torras. They said that the Spanish court would take the date of the issue of the proceedings. They have the clearest support for this view of the domestic Spanish law. In October 1992 the Supreme Court of Spain (civil appeal No.7557) had to decide which of two actions should be treated as the prior. One action had been filed first but the proceedings were not served until after the proceedings in the other had been both filed and served. The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of \u000a
p1510
aV could not be raised in that action.\u000a
p1511
aVHowever it is also clear, and it is accepted by the Appellants before us, that the exception cannot be taken until the proceedings in the action alleged to be the pending action (the \u000a

p1513
aV confines the role of the domestic law to answering the question when were the requirements of that law for the action to have become definitively pending first fulfilled. It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993, that is to say, a date after the date upon which the English court had, on any view, became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties, which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them.\u000a
p1514
aV had been properly raised, Spanish law treated the action as having been pending since the time of filing. There was evidence to support both these submissions as a matter of Spanish law. But they still did not advance the Appellants' case under the Convention. The test laid down in \u000a
p1515
aV test at any of the earlier stages. It may be impossible to say definitively who are going to be the parties and what are going to be the causes of action. .All these difficulties applied in the present case. But the Appellants had a further difficulty. As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted. It was not until February 1994 that they were finally admitted by an appellate court. (Currently the investigating judge is still carrying out his investigations.) Unless the Appellants can rely upon some principle of relation back, they on any view cannot succeed on this ground of appeal. But as is clearly stated in \u000a
p1516
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1517
aVThe third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions, that is to say, actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action. This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a
p1518
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a
p1519
aVIt is accepted that his reason under (iv) cannot stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras, Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies.\u000a
p1520
aVWhilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same, the subject matter of the two articles is different. Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; Article 22 applies to related actions, that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 27.3. This relationship was emphasised in \u000a
p1521
aV, were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England. The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions; one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied. The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together. The Court held:\u000a
p1522
aV36. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that, on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention, where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State, the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1523
aVThus the Court held that a party by party approach must be adopted: to the extent that any of the parties in the relevant actions are the same, then Article 21 applies to those actions insofar as those actions are between those parties and not otherwise. The Court also recognised that this has the result that litigation may become fragmented. A court may have to decline jurisdiction as between some parties but allow the action to continue as between others. An Article 22 question will then almost certainly arise and have to be addressed by the court (or courts) to which that article applies.\u000a
p1524
aVForensically, each advocate sought to extend his argument from one of the articles, 21 or 22, to the other. The Respondents' argument had obvious force where the question is which of the two courts was first seized of one of the related actions to which Article 22 applies; they then, with less conviction and little loyalty to \u000a
p1525
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a

aVIf admission is not to be adopted as the stage at which the Spanish civil court is to be treated as seized of the action for the purposes of the Convention, the choice lies between the date of filing and the date of service.

aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action.

aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1534
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a

aVTitle II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction. This is a necessary corollary of Title III. In particular, provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments. Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State. Under Article 6, a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State (para.l); third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted (paras.2&3}. It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments, either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense. These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8, which is headed: \u000a

Knox J held that the first of these issues fell within Article 16 (2) but that the second did not. We agree with him that the first issue plainly fell within the scope of the Article, but we should wish to reserve for future consideration the correctness of his decision that the second did not. The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company.

aV. His decision on the question whether, for the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings were between the same parties was therefore, on any view, reached on the wrong basis and must be reconsidered. He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.\u000a
p1547
aVIt is accepted that his reason under (iv) cannot stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras, Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies.\u000a
p1548
aVThe Defendants' expert accordingly reasoned that the application of Article 21 simply involved the application of the domestic Spanish law and asking what date would the Spanish court take for the purpose of assessing the priority to be given to the Quail action if an exception of \u000a
p1549
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a

In October 1992 the Supreme Court of Spain (civil appeal No.7557) had to decide which of two actions should be treated as the prior. One action had been filed first but the proceedings were not served until after the proceedings in the other had been both filed and served. The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of \u000a

At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in \u000a

aV Knox J drew a distinction between validity and propriety. He was concerned with an action in which it was alleged that officers of the company had acted in excess of their powers (i) because they had acted without the authority of a properly convened and quorate board meeting and (ii) because the transaction to which they had committed the company was so detrimental to the interests of the company that no reasonable board of directors could properly have assented to it.

aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1557
aV21. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\u000a

aV(v) on an overall comparison .... there is no identity of causes of action .... if it were right to look solely at the position as between GT and the co-plaintiffs to the amended \u000a

aV proceedings, the amended Quail proceedings would in this respect involve the same cause of action between the game parties.\u000a
p1561
aVIt is thus the amended Quail proceedings that are directly relevant. As Mance J has held, they are to a certain extent between the same parties and involve the same cause of action. The critical question therefore becomes which court was first seized.\u000a

aV14. It may properly be inferred from Article 21, read as a whole, that a court's obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. Beyond that, Article 21 gives no indication of the nature of the procedural formalities which must be taken into account for the purposes of considering whether or not to recognise the existence of such an effect. In particular, it gives no indication as to the answer to the question whether a \u000a

The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together. The Court held:\u000a
p1566
aV36. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that, on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention, where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State, the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1567
aVone is asking about. The logical force of this submission is compelling and it is clearly supported by the authorities. The Respondents on the other hand argued for a more pragmatic approach. They pointed out that part of the purpose of the Convention was the simplification of procedures. They argued that .Articles 22 and 21 should be construed together and that the court should always ask itself as a threshold question which court was first seized; it is only after that question has been answered that the court second seized need consider under .Article 21 the extent to which the action before it involves the same cause of action and is between the same parties. Hence, they argue that the relevant date for Article 21 (and Article 22) is the first date upon which it can be said that any defendant has been served.\u000a
p1568
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1569
aVFor the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings which are relevant are, in England, the present action and, in Spain, the 'Quail' proceedings. (We will leave on one side for the time being the criminal proceedings; we consider that the Judge was clearly correct in his conclusion that they could not assist the Defendant's case on Article 21.) After the amendment of the Quail action, the parties who are common to the English action and to the amended Quail action are Grupo Torras and messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler. It is accepted for present purposes that the causes of action as between these parties are the same in the two actions. Approaching the matter on a party by party basis, as contended for by the Appellants, and applying \u000a
p1570
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a
p1571
aV(1) The Spanish courts became seized on 9th June 1992 because once the Quail proceedings had been amended (on 18th May 1993) the amendment related back under Spanish procedural law to the original date of filing and the date of filing is the date upon which a Spanish court becomes under Spanish procedural law seized of an action. This way of putting their case would, if accepted, also make the Article 21 interpretation dispute academic; 9th June 1992 precedes any possible date for the English proceedings.\u000a
p1572
aV confines the role of the domestic law to answering the question when were the requirements of that law for the action to have become definitively pending first fulfilled. It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993, that is to say, a date after the date upon which the English court had, on any view, became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties, which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them.\u000a
p1573
aV test at any of the earlier stages. It may be impossible to say definitively who are going to be the parties and what are going to be the causes of action. .All these difficulties applied in the present case. But the Appellants had a further difficulty. As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted. It was not until February 1994 that they were finally admitted by an appellate court. (Currently the investigating judge is still carrying out his investigations.) Unless the Appellants can rely upon some principle of relation back, they on any view cannot succeed on this ground of appeal. But as is clearly stated in \u000a
p1574
aVThe third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions, that is to say, actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action. This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a
p1575
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1576
aVForensically, each advocate sought to extend his argument from one of the articles, 21 or 22, to the other. The Respondents' argument had obvious force where the question is which of the two courts was first seized of one of the related actions to which Article 22 applies; they then, with less conviction and little loyalty to \u000a
p1577
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1578
aV, the arguments of the Respondents before us are substantially to the same effect and would, if accepted, lead to the same conclusion. The Respondents, relying upon the arguments to which we have referred, submitted that the date upon which the English court became seized of the present action was still, for the purposes of Article 21, 15th April 1993, the date upon which the first batch of Defendants were served. But it is not necessary for us to rule upon this submission since in our judgment the English court was the first seized whether the 15th April is the correct date or some later date down to the end of June by which time, on either side's submissions, all the relevant Defendants save Mr. Nunez had been served with the English writ.\u000a
p1579
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted.

p1581
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies. The personal Defendants are officers of or professional advisers to the Plaintiff companies; they are said to have engineered or facilitated the frauds. The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds. All but one of the Defendants (the Fourth Defendant, Walid Edmond Moukarzel) challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, seeking to set aside or stay the proceedings under RSC Order 12, rule 8 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The central question is where should the Plaintiffs' claims be tried, in England, as the Plaintiffs contend, or in Spain, as the Defendants contend. Mr Justice Mance rejected the challenge of all the Defendants, save in the case of the claim of Grupo Torras against Coll & Company Ltd. where the proceedings have been stayed pursuant to an arbitration clause. Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a
p1582
aVThe Plaintiffs' claims relate to four separate but interrelated transactions. It is unnecessary to describe these transactions in detail. In outline they were as follows:\u000a
p1583
aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1584
aVAn extremely complex cover up scheme is alleged to have been set up to conceal the true nature of this arrangement. It is unnecessary to say more than that again the 'loans' or 'transactions' are said to be sham. Since the hearing before Mance J. the Plaintiffs claim to have traced US $105 million of the Pincinco money to an account owned and controlled by Mr de la Rosa.\u000a
p1585
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a
p1586
aVThe proceedings before Mance J. lasted 25 days and led to a judgment extending to 174 pages in which the Judge carefully went through the points which had been argued before him. Much of the time was taken up by submissions on behalf of the Defendants that there were no serious issues to be tried. Save in respect of the claim of Torras London in the Wardbase transaction, where the Judge held that Torras London had no arguable claim to have been the victim of a conspiracy or to have suffered loss, he rejected those submissions. We find it difficult to see how it could properly have been argued at such length that there was no serious issue to be tried: (See \u000a
p1587
aVSecondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline, or at the least defer, jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized. At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in \u000a
p1588
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action. The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1589
aVThe third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions, that is to say, actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action. This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a
p1590
aVThe length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days. The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject (subject to an immaterial qualification) the applications of the Defendants. He held that Article 16(2) did not apply. He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a
p1591
aV(b)  The Quail action.\u000a
p1592
aV(3)  That the Court should stay the action under Article 22.\u000a
p1593
aV(4)  That, if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21, or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 16(2) or 22, the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under O.li, or should stay, the remainder of the action.\u000a
p1594
aVThe Article 16(2) point is free-standing. The Article 21 and 22 points are inter-related as they both raise the question whether the English court was the court first seized. This is a question partly of European law (the Convention), partly of English procedural law (when was the English court seized of the action?) and partly a question of fact when under Spanish procedural law the Spanish courts became seized of the proceedings before them.\u000a
p1595
aV. This submission is far too wide. Whether an action falls within Article 16(2) depends upon its subject matter - the nature of the dispute - not upon the relationship between the parties. A claim by an officer of a company for wrongful dismissal, for example, does not fall within the Article, though a claim that the decision to dismiss him had been taken by a meeting of the board which was inquorate would do so.\u000a
p1596
aV Knox J drew a distinction between validity and propriety. He was concerned with an action in which it was alleged that officers of the company had acted in excess of their powers (i) because they had acted without the authority of a properly convened and quorate board meeting and (ii) because the transaction to which they had committed the company was so detrimental to the interests of the company that no reasonable board of directors could properly have assented to it. Knox J held that the first of these issues fell within Article 16 (2) but that the second did not. We agree with him that the first issue plainly fell within the scope of the Article, but we should wish to reserve for future consideration the correctness of his decision that the second did not. The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company. Allegations of the kind made in \u000a
p1597
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a
p1598
aVThe Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, or those of them who were in a position to do so assisted by the others, misappropriated enormous sums of the Plaintiffs' money by procuring sums to be paid into offshore bank accounts set up to disguise the identity of the recipients, without the Plaintiffs receiving any benefit from the payments, and that they arranged for the true nature of the transactions to be concealed from the Plaintiffs and their auditors by a series of complicated but sham accounting transactions. As a result of interlocutory proceedings, the destination of some of the money has been identified. Very large sums have found their way to the First, Third and Fifth Defendants or offshore companies controlled by them, and substantial sums have been expended by them on maintaining luxurious lifestyles or funding private business enterprises of their own.\u000a
p1599
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1600
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1601
aV (1882) 21 Ch.D. 292 but is inherently absurd. The provision of loan capital and its conversion into share capital are self-contained commercial transactions in which the company gives and receives value. By themselves they are incapable of mitigating or avoiding the loss which the company sustained by the theft of its funds.\u000a
p1602
aVThe subject matter of this action remains the frauds which it is alleged that the Defendants have practised on the Plaintiff companies. The object of these proceedings is not decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras (nor, for that matter, of Torras London).\u000a
p1603
aVAccordingly, even on the construction of Article 16(2) contended for by the Defendants, the present proceedings clearly fall outside it. Article 16(2} does not debar the English courts from assuming jurisdiction in respect of the present action.\u000a
p1604
aV21. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\u000a
p1605
aV22. Where related actions are brought in the courtB of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised may, while the actions are pending at first instance, stay its proceedings.\u000a
p1606
aVA court other than the court first Eeised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the law of that court permits the consolidation of related actions and the court first seised has jurisdiction over both actions.\u000a
p1607
aVFor the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the riek of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\u000a
p1608
aVAs previously stated, the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized, it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions, this action in England and the criminal, guerelJa, proceedings and the Quail action in Spain.\u000a
p1609
aVQuestions of foreign law are questions of fact which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Judge. If the evidence of expert witnesses conflicts, it is the Judge's duty to resolve these differences in the same way as he must in the case of other conflicting evidence of fact: (\u000a
p1610
aV. His decision on the question whether, for the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings were between the same parties was therefore, on any view, reached on the wrong basis and must be reconsidered. He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.\u000a
p1611
aV(iii) it follows from conclusion (ii) that there is no basis for applying Article 21 or 23 since the present action was the first action definitively pending;\u000a
p1612
aV(iv) the Spanish civil proceedings are not between the same parties (or, if this be the test, between substantially the same parties) as the present English action within the meaning of Article 21 - this follows from my general conclusion that the two sets of proceedings should be compared overall;\u000a
p1613
aV(v) (a) the Spanish civil proceedings do not involve the same (or substantially the same) cause of action as the present English action;\u000a
p1614
aV(b) if they had done, I would have been prepared to allow Grupo Torras to make a reservation in respect of the four transactions in the Spanish criminal proceedings;\u000a
p1615
aVIt is accepted that his reason under (iv) cannot stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras, Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies.\u000a
p1616
aVIn relation to the Quail action he said at p.124);\u000a
p1617
aV(iii) both such dates post-date the English court's definitive seizure of the present action on 15th April 1993, applying the view which I take of definitive seizure under English law;\u000a
p1618
aV(iv) Neither the original nor the amended Quail proceedings is between the same or (substantially the same) parties as the present action - again this follows from my conclusion that the two sets of proceedings fall to be compared overall;\u000a
p1619
aV(v) on an overall comparison .... there is no identity of causes of action .... if it were right to look solely at the position as between GT and the co-plaintiffs to the amended \u000a
p1620
aV proceedings, the amended Quail proceedings would in this respect involve the same cause of action between the game parties.\u000a
p1621
aVIt is thus the amended Quail proceedings that are directly relevant. As Mance J has held, they are to a certain extent between the same parties and involve the same cause of action. The critical question therefore becomes which court was first seized.\u000a
p1622
aVTitle II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction. This is a necessary corollary of Title III. In particular, provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments. Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State. Under Article 6, a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State (para.l); third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted (paras.2&3}. It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments, either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense. These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8, which is headed: \u000a
p1623
aV - related actions.\u000a
p1624
aVWhilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same, the subject matter of the two articles is different. Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; Article 22 applies to related actions, that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 27.3. This relationship was emphasised in \u000a
p1625
aV. In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made, supported by the Advocate-General, that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22, for instance, the moment the proceedings were served. The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continued:\u000a
p1626
aV, therefore, it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties, as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action, a concept which is peculiar to German law and which, because of its characteristics, cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned.\u000a
p1627
aV14. It may properly be inferred from Article 21, read as a whole, that a court's obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. Beyond that, Article 21 gives no indication of the nature of the procedural formalities which must be taken into account for the purposes of considering whether or not to recognise the existence of such an effect. In particular, it gives no indication as to the answer to the question whether a \u000a
p1628
aV15. Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law. That method allows each court to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty, by reference to its own national law, as regards itself, and by reference to the national law of any other court which has been seised, as regards that court, the order or priority in time of several actions brought within the conditions laid down by the Convention.\u000a
p1629
aVThus the Court declined the invitation to lay down any particular time at which any action would become pending. In the final sentence of paragraph 14, the Court accepted that the Convention does not preclude the possibility that the receipt by a court of an application may be the moment at which a \u000a
p1630
aV judgment expressly recognises that a court considering an .Article 21 or 22 question will have not only to consider the pendency of the action before it under its own national law but also the pendency under the national laws of other States of any relevant actions pending before the courts of the other States, (para.15) Thus it recognises that the courts of one State will have to reach a decision regarding the pendency of an action before the courts of another State notwithstanding that the question involves the national law of that other State.\u000a
p1631
aV tl994 2 Lloyds 6, the Court of Appeal has held that in English procedural law an action becomes definitively pending upon the service of the writ, not upon its mere issue. This is authority binding upon us, as it was on Mance J, that the present action was not definitively pending - that the English court was not seized of this action - until the writ had been served.\u000a
p1632
aV (406/92), delivered on 6th December 1994, no judgment had had to address the question of multiple parties. That case concerned the carriage on the vessel, the Tatry, of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated, it was said, by diesel oil. Various actions and cross-actions, \u000a
p1633
aV, were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England. The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions; one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied. The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together. The Court held:\u000a
p1634
aV33. In the light of the wording of Article 21 of the Convention and the objective set out above, that article must be understood as requiring, as a condition of the obligation of the second court seised to decline jurisdiction, that the parties to the two actions be identical.\u000a
p1635
aV34. Consequently, where some of the parties are the same as the parties to an action which has already been started, Article 21 requires the second court seised to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings pending before it are also parties to the action previously started before the court of another Contracting state; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1636
aV35. Admittedly, that interpretation of Article 21 involves fragmenting the proceedings. However, Article 22 mitigates that disadvantage. That article allows the second court seised to stay proceedings or to decline jurisdiction on the ground that the actions are related, if the conditions there set out are satisfied.\u000a
p1637
aV36. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that, on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention, where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State, the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1638
aVThus the Court held that a party by party approach must be adopted: to the extent that any of the parties in the relevant actions are the same, then Article 21 applies to those actions insofar as those actions are between those parties and not otherwise. The Court also recognised that this has the result that litigation may become fragmented. A court may have to decline jurisdiction as between some parties but allow the action to continue as between others. An Article 22 question will then almost certainly arise and have to be addressed by the court (or courts) to which that article applies.\u000a
p1639
aVone is asking about. The logical force of this submission is compelling and it is clearly supported by the authorities. The Respondents on the other hand argued for a more pragmatic approach. They pointed out that part of the purpose of the Convention was the simplification of procedures. They argued that .Articles 22 and 21 should be construed together and that the court should always ask itself as a threshold question which court was first seized; it is only after that question has been answered that the court second seized need consider under .Article 21 the extent to which the action before it involves the same cause of action and is between the same parties. Hence, they argue that the relevant date for Article 21 (and Article 22) is the first date upon which it can be said that any defendant has been served.\u000a
p1640
aVForensically, each advocate sought to extend his argument from one of the articles, 21 or 22, to the other. The Respondents' argument had obvious force where the question is which of the two courts was first seized of one of the related actions to which Article 22 applies; they then, with less conviction and little loyalty to \u000a
p1641
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1642
aVThe interpretation 'which best matches the context and purpose of the Convention' is in my judgment one which gives a single date of definitive pendency for each action by taking the date of first service on any defendant in a case of multiple defendants.\u000a
p1643
aV, the arguments of the Respondents before us are substantially to the same effect and would, if accepted, lead to the same conclusion. The Respondents, relying upon the arguments to which we have referred, submitted that the date upon which the English court became seized of the present action was still, for the purposes of Article 21, 15th April 1993, the date upon which the first batch of Defendants were served. But it is not necessary for us to rule upon this submission since in our judgment the English court was the first seized whether the 15th April is the correct date or some later date down to the end of June by which time, on either side's submissions, all the relevant Defendants save Mr. Nunez had been served with the English writ.\u000a
p1644
aVFor the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings which are relevant are, in England, the present action and, in Spain, the 'Quail' proceedings. (We will leave on one side for the time being the criminal proceedings; we consider that the Judge was clearly correct in his conclusion that they could not assist the Defendant's case on Article 21.) After the amendment of the Quail action, the parties who are common to the English action and to the amended Quail action are Grupo Torras and messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler. It is accepted for present purposes that the causes of action as between these parties are the same in the two actions. Approaching the matter on a party by party basis, as contended for by the Appellants, and applying \u000a
p1645
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a
p1646
aV(1) The Spanish courts became seized on 9th June 1992 because once the Quail proceedings had been amended (on 18th May 1993) the amendment related back under Spanish procedural law to the original date of filing and the date of filing is the date upon which a Spanish court becomes under Spanish procedural law seized of an action. This way of putting their case would, if accepted, also make the Article 21 interpretation dispute academic; 9th June 1992 precedes any possible date for the English proceedings.\u000a
p1647
aVThe Judge's finding that admission was the critical date for civil proceedings was contrary to the views of both side's experts. It has been submitted to us that he failed to make a necessary distinction between what was involved in the admission of ordinary civil proceedings (like the Quail action) and the admission of criminal proceedings started by \u000a
p1648
aVIt was accepted before us that the effect of the expert evidence was that in ordinary civil proceedings the step of admission was a purely administrative exercise, checking the documents filed by the plaintiff to see that they comply with the formal requirements and are complete. Unlike the position in the procedural law governing Spanish criminal proceedings, admission does not involve any decision by the court or any determination that the court seize itself of the proceedings. Put at its highest, it is merely the stage at which the papers are accepted as fit for service. Therefore we accept the primary submission of both parties that, on the evidence, the date of admission cannot be taken as the date on which the Spanish court became seized of the Quail or amended Quail action.\u000a
p1649
aVIf admission is not to be adopted as the stage at which the Spanish civil court is to be treated as seized of the action for the purposes of the Convention, the choice lies between the date of filing and the date of service. In our judgment, the choice does not depend upon determining any contentious question of Spanish law: the difference between the parties depends upon how the question ought to be approached as a matter of the implementation of the Convention.\u000a
p1650
aV has the character of a procedural defence. Its validity is determined upon a basis of priority. The prior action has the status of being pending; it is treated as being the 'master' and the second action must defer to it. The exception of \u000a
p1651
aV having been raised in the second action and upheld, the judge has -various procedural powers to ensure that the relevant matters are all determined in the first action. It was the view of the Spanish witnesses, at least on the Defendants' side, that Article 21 of the Convention was an implementation of the same principle of procedural law.\u000a
p1652
aVThe Defendants' expert accordingly reasoned that the application of Article 21 simply involved the application of the domestic Spanish law and asking what date would the Spanish court take for the purpose of assessing the priority to be given to the Quail action if an exception of \u000a
p1653
aV was raised in it by Grupo Torras. They said that the Spanish court would take the date of the issue of the proceedings. They have the clearest support for this view of the domestic Spanish law. In October 1992 the Supreme Court of Spain (civil appeal No.7557) had to decide which of two actions should be treated as the prior. One action had been filed first but the proceedings were not served until after the proceedings in the other had been both filed and served. The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of \u000a
p1654
aV could not be raised in that action.\u000a
p1655
aVHowever it is also clear, and it is accepted by the Appellants before us, that the exception cannot be taken until the proceedings in the action alleged to be the pending action (the \u000a
p1656
aVOn the findings which the Appellants accept, it is clear that the requirements of Spanish law for an action to become definitively pending are that it has been filed, accepted and served. Until all those requirements have been met, it cannot be relied upon as a - \u000a
p1657
aV confines the role of the domestic law to answering the question when were the requirements of that law for the action to have become definitively pending first fulfilled. It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993, that is to say, a date after the date upon which the English court had, on any view, became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties, which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them.\u000a
p1658
aV had been properly raised, Spanish law treated the action as having been pending since the time of filing. There was evidence to support both these submissions as a matter of Spanish law. But they still did not advance the Appellants' case under the Convention. The test laid down in \u000a
p1659
aV test at any of the earlier stages. It may be impossible to say definitively who are going to be the parties and what are going to be the causes of action. .All these difficulties applied in the present case. But the Appellants had a further difficulty. As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted. It was not until February 1994 that they were finally admitted by an appellate court. (Currently the investigating judge is still carrying out his investigations.) Unless the Appellants can rely upon some principle of relation back, they on any view cannot succeed on this ground of appeal. But as is clearly stated in \u000a
p1660
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies. The personal Defendants are officers of or professional advisers to the Plaintiff companies; they are said to have engineered or facilitated the frauds. The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds. All but one of the Defendants (the Fourth Defendant, Walid Edmond Moukarzel) challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, seeking to set aside or stay the proceedings under RSC Order 12, rule 8 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The central question is where should the Plaintiffs' claims be tried, in England, as the Plaintiffs contend, or in Spain, as the Defendants contend. Mr Justice Mance rejected the challenge of all the Defendants, save in the case of the claim of Grupo Torras against Coll & Company Ltd. where the proceedings have been stayed pursuant to an arbitration clause. Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a
p1661
aVSecondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline, or at the least defer, jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized. At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in \u000a
p1662
aVThe length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days. The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject (subject to an immaterial qualification) the applications of the Defendants. He held that Article 16(2) did not apply. He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a
p1663
aV. This submission is far too wide. Whether an action falls within Article 16(2) depends upon its subject matter - the nature of the dispute - not upon the relationship between the parties. A claim by an officer of a company for wrongful dismissal, for example, does not fall within the Article, though a claim that the decision to dismiss him had been taken by a meeting of the board which was inquorate would do so.\u000a
p1664
aV Knox J drew a distinction between validity and propriety. He was concerned with an action in which it was alleged that officers of the company had acted in excess of their powers (i) because they had acted without the authority of a properly convened and quorate board meeting and (ii) because the transaction to which they had committed the company was so detrimental to the interests of the company that no reasonable board of directors could properly have assented to it. Knox J held that the first of these issues fell within Article 16 (2) but that the second did not. We agree with him that the first issue plainly fell within the scope of the Article, but we should wish to reserve for future consideration the correctness of his decision that the second did not. The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company. Allegations of the kind made in \u000a
p1665
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1666
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1667
aVThe subject matter of this action remains the frauds which it is alleged that the Defendants have practised on the Plaintiff companies. The object of these proceedings is not decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras (nor, for that matter, of Torras London).\u000a
p1668
aV. His decision on the question whether, for the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings were between the same parties was therefore, on any view, reached on the wrong basis and must be reconsidered. He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.\u000a
p1669
aV judgment expressly recognises that a court considering an .Article 21 or 22 question will have not only to consider the pendency of the action before it under its own national law but also the pendency under the national laws of other States of any relevant actions pending before the courts of the other States, (para.15) Thus it recognises that the courts of one State will have to reach a decision regarding the pendency of an action before the courts of another State notwithstanding that the question involves the national law of that other State.\u000a
p1670
aVIt was accepted before us that the effect of the expert evidence was that in ordinary civil proceedings the step of admission was a purely administrative exercise, checking the documents filed by the plaintiff to see that they comply with the formal requirements and are complete. Unlike the position in the procedural law governing Spanish criminal proceedings, admission does not involve any decision by the court or any determination that the court seize itself of the proceedings. Put at its highest, it is merely the stage at which the papers are accepted as fit for service. Therefore we accept the primary submission of both parties that, on the evidence, the date of admission cannot be taken as the date on which the Spanish court became seized of the Quail or amended Quail action.\u000a
p1671
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies.

Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a
p1672
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a
p1673
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies.

Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a
p1674
aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1675
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action. The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1676
aV. This submission is far too wide. Whether an action falls within Article 16(2) depends upon its subject matter - the nature of the dispute - not upon the relationship between the parties. A claim by an officer of a company for wrongful dismissal, for example, does not fall within the Article, though a claim that the decision to dismiss him had been taken by a meeting of the board which was inquorate would do so.\u000a
p1677
aV Knox J drew a distinction between validity and propriety. He was concerned with an action in which it was alleged that officers of the company had acted in excess of their powers (i) because they had acted without the authority of a properly convened and quorate board meeting and (ii) because the transaction to which they had committed the company was so detrimental to the interests of the company that no reasonable board of directors could properly have assented to it. Knox J held that the first of these issues fell within Article 16 (2) but that the second did not. We agree with him that the first issue plainly fell within the scope of the Article, but we should wish to reserve for future consideration the correctness of his decision that the second did not. The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company. Allegations of the kind made in \u000a
p1678
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a
p1679
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1680
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a

aV (1882) 21 Ch.D. 292 but is inherently absurd. The provision of loan capital and its conversion into share capital are self-contained commercial transactions in which the company gives and receives value. By themselves they are incapable of mitigating or avoiding the loss which the company sustained by the theft of its funds.\u000a

aV15. Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law. That method allows each court to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty, by reference to its own national law, as regards itself, and by reference to the national law of any other court which has been seised, as regards that court, the order or priority in time of several actions brought within the conditions laid down by the Convention.\u000a

aV confines the role of the domestic law to answering the question when were the requirements of that law for the action to have become definitively pending first fulfilled. It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993, that is to say, a date after the date upon which the English court had, on any view, became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties, which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them.\u000a
p1685
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a

p1689
aV was raised in it by Grupo Torras. They said that the Spanish court would take the date of the issue of the proceedings. They have the clearest support for this view of the domestic Spanish law. In October 1992 the Supreme Court of Spain (civil appeal No.7557) had to decide which of two actions should be treated as the prior. One action had been filed first but the proceedings were not served until after the proceedings in the other had been both filed and served. The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of \u000a

This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a

p1693
aVForensically, each advocate sought to extend his argument from one of the articles, 21 or 22, to the other. The Respondents' argument had obvious force where the question is which of the two courts was first seized of one of the related actions to which Article 22 applies; they then, with less conviction and little loyalty to \u000a
p1694
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1695
aV, the arguments of the Respondents before us are substantially to the same effect and would, if accepted, lead to the same conclusion. The Respondents, relying upon the arguments to which we have referred, submitted that the date upon which the English court became seized of the present action was still, for the purposes of Article 21, 15th April 1993, the date upon which the first batch of Defendants were served. But it is not necessary for us to rule upon this submission since in our judgment the English court was the first seized whether the 15th April is the correct date or some later date down to the end of June by which time, on either side's submissions, all the relevant Defendants save Mr. Nunez had been served with the English writ.\u000a
p1696
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted.

We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a
p1697
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies. The personal Defendants are officers of or professional advisers to the Plaintiff companies; they are said to have engineered or facilitated the frauds. The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds. All but one of the Defendants (the Fourth Defendant, Walid Edmond Moukarzel) challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, seeking to set aside or stay the proceedings under RSC Order 12, rule 8 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The central question is where should the Plaintiffs' claims be tried, in England, as the Plaintiffs contend, or in Spain, as the Defendants contend. Mr Justice Mance rejected the challenge of all the Defendants, save in the case of the claim of Grupo Torras against Coll & Company Ltd. where the proceedings have been stayed pursuant to an arbitration clause. Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a

aV test at any of the earlier stages. It may be impossible to say definitively who are going to be the parties and what are going to be the causes of action. .All these difficulties applied in the present case. But the Appellants had a further difficulty. As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted. It was not until February 1994 that they were finally admitted by an appellate court. (Currently the investigating judge is still carrying out his investigations.) Unless the Appellants can rely upon some principle of relation back, they on any view cannot succeed on this ground of appeal. But as is clearly stated in \u000a

aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action.

aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1706
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a
p1707
aVSecondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline, or at the least defer, jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized. At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in \u000a

This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a
p1710
aVThe length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days. The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject (subject to an immaterial qualification) the applications of the Defendants. He held that Article 16(2) did not apply. He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a
p1711
aV(4)  That, if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21, or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 16(2) or 22, the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under O.li, or should stay, the remainder of the action.\u000a
p1712
aVThe Article 16(2) point is free-standing. The Article 21 and 22 points are inter-related as they both raise the question whether the English court was the court first seized. This is a question partly of European law (the Convention), partly of English procedural law (when was the English court seized of the action?) and partly a question of fact when under Spanish procedural law the Spanish courts became seized of the proceedings before them.\u000a
p1713
aV. This submission is far too wide. Whether an action falls within Article 16(2) depends upon its subject matter - the nature of the dispute - not upon the relationship between the parties. A claim by an officer of a company for wrongful dismissal, for example, does not fall within the Article, though a claim that the decision to dismiss him had been taken by a meeting of the board which was inquorate would do so.\u000a
p1714
aV21. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\u000a
p1715
aVA court other than the court first Eeised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the law of that court permits the consolidation of related actions and the court first seised has jurisdiction over both actions.\u000a
p1716
aV. His decision on the question whether, for the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings were between the same parties was therefore, on any view, reached on the wrong basis and must be reconsidered. He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.\u000a
p1717
aV(iv) the Spanish civil proceedings are not between the same parties (or, if this be the test, between substantially the same parties) as the present English action within the meaning of Article 21 - this follows from my general conclusion that the two sets of proceedings should be compared overall;\u000a
p1718
aVIt is accepted that his reason under (iv) cannot stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras, Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies.\u000a
p1719
aV(iv) Neither the original nor the amended Quail proceedings is between the same or (substantially the same) parties as the present action - again this follows from my conclusion that the two sets of proceedings fall to be compared overall;\u000a
p1720
aV proceedings, the amended Quail proceedings would in this respect involve the same cause of action between the game parties.\u000a
p1721
aVIt is thus the amended Quail proceedings that are directly relevant. As Mance J has held, they are to a certain extent between the same parties and involve the same cause of action. The critical question therefore becomes which court was first seized.\u000a
p1722
aVTitle II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction. This is a necessary corollary of Title III. In particular, provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments. Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State. Under Article 6, a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State (para.l); third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted (paras.2&3}. It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments, either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense. These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8, which is headed: \u000a
p1723
aVWhilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same, the subject matter of the two articles is different. Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; Article 22 applies to related actions, that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 27.3. This relationship was emphasised in \u000a
p1724
aV, therefore, it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties, as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action, a concept which is peculiar to German law and which, because of its characteristics, cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned.\u000a
p1725
aV14. It may properly be inferred from Article 21, read as a whole, that a court's obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. Beyond that, Article 21 gives no indication of the nature of the procedural formalities which must be taken into account for the purposes of considering whether or not to recognise the existence of such an effect. In particular, it gives no indication as to the answer to the question whether a \u000a
p1726
aVThus the Court declined the invitation to lay down any particular time at which any action would become pending. In the final sentence of paragraph 14, the Court accepted that the Convention does not preclude the possibility that the receipt by a court of an application may be the moment at which a \u000a
p1727
aV (406/92), delivered on 6th December 1994, no judgment had had to address the question of multiple parties. That case concerned the carriage on the vessel, the Tatry, of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated, it was said, by diesel oil. Various actions and cross-actions, \u000a
p1728
aV, were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England. The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions; one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied. The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together. The Court held:\u000a
p1729
aV33. In the light of the wording of Article 21 of the Convention and the objective set out above, that article must be understood as requiring, as a condition of the obligation of the second court seised to decline jurisdiction, that the parties to the two actions be identical.\u000a
p1730
aV34. Consequently, where some of the parties are the same as the parties to an action which has already been started, Article 21 requires the second court seised to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings pending before it are also parties to the action previously started before the court of another Contracting state; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a

aV36. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that, on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention, where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State, the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1732
aVThus the Court held that a party by party approach must be adopted: to the extent that any of the parties in the relevant actions are the same, then Article 21 applies to those actions insofar as those actions are between those parties and not otherwise. The Court also recognised that this has the result that litigation may become fragmented. A court may have to decline jurisdiction as between some parties but allow the action to continue as between others. An Article 22 question will then almost certainly arise and have to be addressed by the court (or courts) to which that article applies.\u000a
p1733
aVone is asking about. The logical force of this submission is compelling and it is clearly supported by the authorities. The Respondents on the other hand argued for a more pragmatic approach. They pointed out that part of the purpose of the Convention was the simplification of procedures. They argued that .Articles 22 and 21 should be construed together and that the court should always ask itself as a threshold question which court was first seized; it is only after that question has been answered that the court second seized need consider under .Article 21 the extent to which the action before it involves the same cause of action and is between the same parties. Hence, they argue that the relevant date for Article 21 (and Article 22) is the first date upon which it can be said that any defendant has been served.\u000a
p1734
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1735
aVFor the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings which are relevant are, in England, the present action and, in Spain, the 'Quail' proceedings. (We will leave on one side for the time being the criminal proceedings; we consider that the Judge was clearly correct in his conclusion that they could not assist the Defendant's case on Article 21.) After the amendment of the Quail action, the parties who are common to the English action and to the amended Quail action are Grupo Torras and messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler. It is accepted for present purposes that the causes of action as between these parties are the same in the two actions. Approaching the matter on a party by party basis, as contended for by the Appellants, and applying \u000a
p1736
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a
p1737
aVIt was accepted before us that the effect of the expert evidence was that in ordinary civil proceedings the step of admission was a purely administrative exercise, checking the documents filed by the plaintiff to see that they comply with the formal requirements and are complete. Unlike the position in the procedural law governing Spanish criminal proceedings, admission does not involve any decision by the court or any determination that the court seize itself of the proceedings. Put at its highest, it is merely the stage at which the papers are accepted as fit for service. Therefore we accept the primary submission of both parties that, on the evidence, the date of admission cannot be taken as the date on which the Spanish court became seized of the Quail or amended Quail action.\u000a
p1738
aVIf admission is not to be adopted as the stage at which the Spanish civil court is to be treated as seized of the action for the purposes of the Convention, the choice lies between the date of filing and the date of service. In our judgment, the choice does not depend upon determining any contentious question of Spanish law: the difference between the parties depends upon how the question ought to be approached as a matter of the implementation of the Convention.\u000a
p1739
aV confines the role of the domestic law to answering the question when were the requirements of that law for the action to have become definitively pending first fulfilled. It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993, that is to say, a date after the date upon which the English court had, on any view, became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties, which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them.\u000a
p1740
aV test at any of the earlier stages. It may be impossible to say definitively who are going to be the parties and what are going to be the causes of action. .All these difficulties applied in the present case. But the Appellants had a further difficulty. As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted. It was not until February 1994 that they were finally admitted by an appellate court. (Currently the investigating judge is still carrying out his investigations.) Unless the Appellants can rely upon some principle of relation back, they on any view cannot succeed on this ground of appeal. But as is clearly stated in \u000a
p1741
aVThe third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions, that is to say, actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action. This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a
p1742
aV14. It may properly be inferred from Article 21, read as a whole, that a court's obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. Beyond that, Article 21 gives no indication of the nature of the procedural formalities which must be taken into account for the purposes of considering whether or not to recognise the existence of such an effect. In particular, it gives no indication as to the answer to the question whether a \u000a

aVThe Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, or those of them who were in a position to do so assisted by the others, misappropriated enormous sums of the Plaintiffs' money by procuring sums to be paid into offshore bank accounts set up to disguise the identity of the recipients, without the Plaintiffs receiving any benefit from the payments, and that they arranged for the true nature of the transactions to be concealed from the Plaintiffs and their auditors by a series of complicated but sham accounting transactions. As a result of interlocutory proceedings, the destination of some of the money has been identified. Very large sums have found their way to the First, Third and Fifth Defendants or offshore companies controlled by them, and substantial sums have been expended by them on maintaining luxurious lifestyles or funding private business enterprises of their own.\u000a

aVThe length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days. The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject (subject to an immaterial qualification) the applications of the Defendants. He held that Article 16(2) did not apply. He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a

p1749
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B.

aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1751
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a

aV, therefore, it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties, as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action, a concept which is peculiar to German law and which, because of its characteristics, cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned.\u000a
p1754
aVTitle II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction. This is a necessary corollary of Title III. In particular, provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments. Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State. Under Article 6, a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State (para.l); third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted (paras.2&3}. It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments, either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense. These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8, which is headed: \u000a
p1755
aVWhilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same, the subject matter of the two articles is different. Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; Article 22 applies to related actions, that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 27.3. This relationship was emphasised in \u000a
p1756
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action. The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1757
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest.

aV. In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made, supported by the Advocate-General, that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22, for instance, the moment the proceedings were served. The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continued:\u000a
p1762
aVThis action was begun by writ issued on 14th April 1993 in the Commercial Court. The First Plaintiff, Grupo Torras SA (Grupo Torras) is a Spanish company; the Second Plaintiff, Torras Hostench London Ltd. (Torras London), is its English subsidiary. The Plaintiffs claim damages for fraudulent conspiracy, monies alleged to be due under constructive trust, and damages for breach of duty by directors of the Plaintiff companies. The personal Defendants are officers of or professional advisers to the Plaintiff companies; they are said to have engineered or facilitated the frauds. The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds. All but one of the Defendants (the Fourth Defendant, Walid Edmond Moukarzel) challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, seeking to set aside or stay the proceedings under RSC Order 12, rule 8 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The central question is where should the Plaintiffs' claims be tried, in England, as the Plaintiffs contend, or in Spain, as the Defendants contend. Mr Justice Mance rejected the challenge of all the Defendants, save in the case of the claim of Grupo Torras against Coll & Company Ltd. where the proceedings have been stayed pursuant to an arbitration clause. Save for the Second Defendant, Richard Robinson, they have all appealed against the decision of the Judge.\u000a
p1763
aVThe Plaintiffs' claims relate to four separate but interrelated transactions. It is unnecessary to describe these transactions in detail. In outline they were as follows:\u000a
p1764
aVIn September 1989, Banco Santander, at the request of Torras London, transferred US $25 million to Kokmeeuw in 'partial repayment' of the transfer of US $27.4 million to the Republic National Bank. It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras. It is said that finally the 'loan' was accounted for by way of intercompany set-off between Grupo Torras and Torras London, and then written off in the Grupo Torras 1990 profit and loss account.\u000a
p1765
aVAn extremely complex cover up scheme is alleged to have been set up to conceal the true nature of this arrangement. It is unnecessary to say more than that again the 'loans' or 'transactions' are said to be sham. Since the hearing before Mance J. the Plaintiffs claim to have traced US $105 million of the Pincinco money to an account owned and controlled by Mr de la Rosa.\u000a
p1766
aVIt is unnecessary to set out the parts played by each of the personal Defendants in these various transactions. Not all were involved in all four transactions. Sheikh Fahad is said to have been central to all of them. The case against the personal Defendants is that they each played a part in securing or facilitating payments which they knew were not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs and in the cover up operations, either as officers or employees of either or both of the Plaintiffs or as their professional advisers. The corporate Defendants, other than Coll & Co., were either the recipients of the payments, the vehicles through which they were made or were otherwise used by those controlling them to conceal the truth by a web of false documentation. The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.\u000a
p1767
aVThe proceedings before Mance J. lasted 25 days and led to a judgment extending to 174 pages in which the Judge carefully went through the points which had been argued before him. Much of the time was taken up by submissions on behalf of the Defendants that there were no serious issues to be tried. Save in respect of the claim of Torras London in the Wardbase transaction, where the Judge held that Torras London had no arguable claim to have been the victim of a conspiracy or to have suffered loss, he rejected those submissions. We find it difficult to see how it could properly have been argued at such length that there was no serious issue to be tried: (See \u000a
p1768
aVSecondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline, or at the least defer, jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized. At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in \u000a
p1769

Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement.

The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1770
aVThe third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions, that is to say, actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments, and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action. This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but, like Article 21, only applies if the English court is not the court first seized.\u000a

He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a

aV(3)  That the Court should stay the action under Article 22.\u000a
p1774
aV(4)  That, if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21, or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 16(2) or 22, the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under O.li, or should stay, the remainder of the action.\u000a
p1775
aVThe Article 16(2) point is free-standing. The Article 21 and 22 points are inter-related as they both raise the question whether the English court was the court first seized. This is a question partly of European law (the Convention), partly of English procedural law (when was the English court seized of the action?) and partly a question of fact when under Spanish procedural law the Spanish courts became seized of the proceedings before them.\u000a
p1776
aV. This submission is far too wide. Whether an action falls within Article 16(2) depends upon its subject matter - the nature of the dispute - not upon the relationship between the parties. A claim by an officer of a company for wrongful dismissal, for example, does not fall within the Article, though a claim that the decision to dismiss him had been taken by a meeting of the board which was inquorate would do so.\u000a
p1777
aV Knox J drew a distinction between validity and propriety. He was concerned with an action in which it was alleged that officers of the company had acted in excess of their powers (i) because they had acted without the authority of a properly convened and quorate board meeting and (ii) because the transaction to which they had committed the company was so detrimental to the interests of the company that no reasonable board of directors could properly have assented to it. Knox J held that the first of these issues fell within Article 16 (2) but that the second did not. We agree with him that the first issue plainly fell within the scope of the Article, but we should wish to reserve for future consideration the correctness of his decision that the second did not. The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company. Allegations of the kind made in \u000a
p1778
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a
p1779
aVThe Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, or those of them who were in a position to do so assisted by the others, misappropriated enormous sums of the Plaintiffs' money by procuring sums to be paid into offshore bank accounts set up to disguise the identity of the recipients, without the Plaintiffs receiving any benefit from the payments, and that they arranged for the true nature of the transactions to be concealed from the Plaintiffs and their auditors by a series of complicated but sham accounting transactions. As a result of interlocutory proceedings, the destination of some of the money has been identified. Very large sums have found their way to the First, Third and Fifth Defendants or offshore companies controlled by them, and substantial sums have been expended by them on maintaining luxurious lifestyles or funding private business enterprises of their own.\u000a

aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a
p1781
aVIt was contended before Mance J, but only faintly before us, that the questions whether the Plaintiffs suffered any loss and whether the Defendants' acts were authorised, ratified and financed by the ultimate controlling shareholders involve questions of Spanish company law and fall within .Article 16(2). They advanced an argument that the Plaintiffs had not suffered any loss on at least three of the transactions because the relevant money had originated from loans by Koolmees to Grupo Torras and in July 1991, at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of Grupo Torras, it was resolved to capitalise the loans by issuing additional share capital to Koolmees in satisfaction for the liability to repay the loans. The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees. The submission is not only inconsistent with the decision of this Court in \u000a
p1782
aV (1882) 21 Ch.D. 292 but is inherently absurd. The provision of loan capital and its conversion into share capital are self-contained commercial transactions in which the company gives and receives value. By themselves they are incapable of mitigating or avoiding the loss which the company sustained by the theft of its funds.\u000a
p1783
aVThe subject matter of this action remains the frauds which it is alleged that the Defendants have practised on the Plaintiff companies. The object of these proceedings is not decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras (nor, for that matter, of Torras London).\u000a
p1784
aVAccordingly, even on the construction of Article 16(2) contended for by the Defendants, the present proceedings clearly fall outside it. Article 16(2} does not debar the English courts from assuming jurisdiction in respect of the present action.\u000a
p1785
aV21. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\u000a
p1786
aV22. Where related actions are brought in the courtB of different Contracting States, any court other than the court first seised may, while the actions are pending at first instance, stay its proceedings.\u000a
p1787
aVA court other than the court first Eeised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the law of that court permits the consolidation of related actions and the court first seised has jurisdiction over both actions.\u000a
p1788
aVFor the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the riek of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.\u000a
p1789
aVAs previously stated, the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized, it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions, this action in England and the criminal, guerelJa, proceedings and the Quail action in Spain.\u000a
p1790
aVQuestions of foreign law are questions of fact which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Judge. If the evidence of expert witnesses conflicts, it is the Judge's duty to resolve these differences in the same way as he must in the case of other conflicting evidence of fact: (\u000a
p1791
aV. His decision on the question whether, for the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings were between the same parties was therefore, on any view, reached on the wrong basis and must be reconsidered. He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.\u000a
p1792
aV(iii) it follows from conclusion (ii) that there is no basis for applying Article 21 or 23 since the present action was the first action definitively pending;\u000a
p1793
aV(iv) the Spanish civil proceedings are not between the same parties (or, if this be the test, between substantially the same parties) as the present English action within the meaning of Article 21 - this follows from my general conclusion that the two sets of proceedings should be compared overall;\u000a
p1794
aV(v) (a) the Spanish civil proceedings do not involve the same (or substantially the same) cause of action as the present English action;\u000a
p1795
aV(b) if they had done, I would have been prepared to allow Grupo Torras to make a reservation in respect of the four transactions in the Spanish criminal proceedings;\u000a
p1796
aVIt is accepted that his reason under (iv) cannot stand and that it is still necessary to consider as between the parties common to both the criminal proceedings and the English action - Grupo Torras, Sheikh Fahad and Messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler - whether Article 21 applies.\u000a
p1797
aVIn relation to the Quail action he said at p.124);\u000a
p1798
aV(iii) both such dates post-date the English court's definitive seizure of the present action on 15th April 1993, applying the view which I take of definitive seizure under English law;\u000a
p1799
aV(iv) Neither the original nor the amended Quail proceedings is between the same or (substantially the same) parties as the present action - again this follows from my conclusion that the two sets of proceedings fall to be compared overall;\u000a
p1800
aV(v) on an overall comparison .... there is no identity of causes of action .... if it were right to look solely at the position as between GT and the co-plaintiffs to the amended \u000a
p1801
aV proceedings, the amended Quail proceedings would in this respect involve the same cause of action between the game parties.\u000a
p1802
aVIt is thus the amended Quail proceedings that are directly relevant. As Mance J has held, they are to a certain extent between the same parties and involve the same cause of action. The critical question therefore becomes which court was first seized.\u000a
p1803
aVTitle II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction. This is a necessary corollary of Title III. In particular, provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments. Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State. Under Article 6, a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State (para.l); third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted (paras.2&3}. It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments, either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense. These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8, which is headed: \u000a
p1804
aV - related actions.\u000a
p1805
aVWhilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same, the subject matter of the two articles is different. Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties; Article 22 applies to related actions, that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments. It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 27.3. This relationship was emphasised in \u000a
p1806
aV. In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made, supported by the Advocate-General, that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22, for instance, the moment the proceedings were served. The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continued:\u000a
p1807
aV, therefore, it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties, as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action, a concept which is peculiar to German law and which, because of its characteristics, cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned.\u000a
p1808
aV14. It may properly be inferred from Article 21, read as a whole, that a court's obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties. Beyond that, Article 21 gives no indication of the nature of the procedural formalities which must be taken into account for the purposes of considering whether or not to recognise the existence of such an effect. In particular, it gives no indication as to the answer to the question whether a \u000a
p1809
aV15. Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law. That method allows each court to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty, by reference to its own national law, as regards itself, and by reference to the national law of any other court which has been seised, as regards that court, the order or priority in time of several actions brought within the conditions laid down by the Convention.\u000a
p1810
aVThus the Court declined the invitation to lay down any particular time at which any action would become pending. In the final sentence of paragraph 14, the Court accepted that the Convention does not preclude the possibility that the receipt by a court of an application may be the moment at which a \u000a
p1811
aV judgment expressly recognises that a court considering an .Article 21 or 22 question will have not only to consider the pendency of the action before it under its own national law but also the pendency under the national laws of other States of any relevant actions pending before the courts of the other States, (para.15) Thus it recognises that the courts of one State will have to reach a decision regarding the pendency of an action before the courts of another State notwithstanding that the question involves the national law of that other State.\u000a
p1812
aV tl994 2 Lloyds 6, the Court of Appeal has held that in English procedural law an action becomes definitively pending upon the service of the writ, not upon its mere issue. This is authority binding upon us, as it was on Mance J, that the present action was not definitively pending - that the English court was not seized of this action - until the writ had been served.\u000a
p1813
aV (406/92), delivered on 6th December 1994, no judgment had had to address the question of multiple parties. That case concerned the carriage on the vessel, the Tatry, of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated, it was said, by diesel oil. Various actions and cross-actions, \u000a
p1814
aV, were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England. The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions; one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied. The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together. The Court held:\u000a
p1815
aV33. In the light of the wording of Article 21 of the Convention and the objective set out above, that article must be understood as requiring, as a condition of the obligation of the second court seised to decline jurisdiction, that the parties to the two actions be identical.\u000a
p1816
aV34. Consequently, where some of the parties are the same as the parties to an action which has already been started, Article 21 requires the second court seised to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings pending before it are also parties to the action previously started before the court of another Contracting state; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1817
aV35. Admittedly, that interpretation of Article 21 involves fragmenting the proceedings. However, Article 22 mitigates that disadvantage. That article allows the second court seised to stay proceedings or to decline jurisdiction on the ground that the actions are related, if the conditions there set out are satisfied.\u000a
p1818
aV36. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that, on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention, where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State, the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced; it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties.\u000a
p1819
aVThus the Court held that a party by party approach must be adopted: to the extent that any of the parties in the relevant actions are the same, then Article 21 applies to those actions insofar as those actions are between those parties and not otherwise. The Court also recognised that this has the result that litigation may become fragmented. A court may have to decline jurisdiction as between some parties but allow the action to continue as between others. An Article 22 question will then almost certainly arise and have to be addressed by the court (or courts) to which that article applies.\u000a
p1820
aVone is asking about. The logical force of this submission is compelling and it is clearly supported by the authorities. The Respondents on the other hand argued for a more pragmatic approach. They pointed out that part of the purpose of the Convention was the simplification of procedures. They argued that .Articles 22 and 21 should be construed together and that the court should always ask itself as a threshold question which court was first seized; it is only after that question has been answered that the court second seized need consider under .Article 21 the extent to which the action before it involves the same cause of action and is between the same parties. Hence, they argue that the relevant date for Article 21 (and Article 22) is the first date upon which it can be said that any defendant has been served.\u000a
p1821
aVForensically, each advocate sought to extend his argument from one of the articles, 21 or 22, to the other. The Respondents' argument had obvious force where the question is which of the two courts was first seized of one of the related actions to which Article 22 applies; they then, with less conviction and little loyalty to \u000a
p1822
aV to which this argument could give rise. In country 'X', A & B sue C, D, E & F; in country 'Y', C & D sue A, B & G. The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a
p1823
aVThe interpretation 'which best matches the context and purpose of the Convention' is in my judgment one which gives a single date of definitive pendency for each action by taking the date of first service on any defendant in a case of multiple defendants.\u000a
p1824
aV, the arguments of the Respondents before us are substantially to the same effect and would, if accepted, lead to the same conclusion. The Respondents, relying upon the arguments to which we have referred, submitted that the date upon which the English court became seized of the present action was still, for the purposes of Article 21, 15th April 1993, the date upon which the first batch of Defendants were served. But it is not necessary for us to rule upon this submission since in our judgment the English court was the first seized whether the 15th April is the correct date or some later date down to the end of June by which time, on either side's submissions, all the relevant Defendants save Mr. Nunez had been served with the English writ.\u000a
p1825
aVFor the purposes of Article 21, the proceedings which are relevant are, in England, the present action and, in Spain, the 'Quail' proceedings. (We will leave on one side for the time being the criminal proceedings; we consider that the Judge was clearly correct in his conclusion that they could not assist the Defendant's case on Article 21.) After the amendment of the Quail action, the parties who are common to the English action and to the amended Quail action are Grupo Torras and messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler. It is accepted for present purposes that the causes of action as between these parties are the same in the two actions. Approaching the matter on a party by party basis, as contended for by the Appellants, and applying \u000a
p1826
aVOn this assumption, the relevant question is whether the Spanish courts became seized as between these parties before 21st June 1993. Mance J held that they did because he held that the Spanish courts became seized on 18th June 1993, the date upon which the amended Quail proceedings were admitted. Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a
p1827
aV(1) The Spanish courts became seized on 9th June 1992 because once the Quail proceedings had been amended (on 18th May 1993) the amendment related back under Spanish procedural law to the original date of filing and the date of filing is the date upon which a Spanish court becomes under Spanish procedural law seized of an action. This way of putting their case would, if accepted, also make the Article 21 interpretation dispute academic; 9th June 1992 precedes any possible date for the English proceedings.\u000a
p1828
aVThe Judge's finding that admission was the critical date for civil proceedings was contrary to the views of both side's experts. It has been submitted to us that he failed to make a necessary distinction between what was involved in the admission of ordinary civil proceedings (like the Quail action) and the admission of criminal proceedings started by \u000a
p1829
aVIt was accepted before us that the effect of the expert evidence was that in ordinary civil proceedings the step of admission was a purely administrative exercise, checking the documents filed by the plaintiff to see that they comply with the formal requirements and are complete. Unlike the position in the procedural law governing Spanish criminal proceedings, admission does not involve any decision by the court or any determination that the court seize itself of the proceedings. Put at its highest, it is merely the stage at which the papers are accepted as fit for service. Therefore we accept the primary submission of both parties that, on the evidence, the date of admission cannot be taken as the date on which the Spanish court became seized of the Quail or amended Quail action.\u000a
p1830
aVIf admission is not to be adopted as the stage at which the Spanish civil court is to be treated as seized of the action for the purposes of the Convention, the choice lies between the date of filing and the date of service. In our judgment, the choice does not depend upon determining any contentious question of Spanish law: the difference between the parties depends upon how the question ought to be approached as a matter of the implementation of the Convention.\u000a
p1831
aV has the character of a procedural defence. Its validity is determined upon a basis of priority. The prior action has the status of being pending; it is treated as being the 'master' and the second action must defer to it. The exception of \u000a
p1832
aV having been raised in the second action and upheld, the judge has -various procedural powers to ensure that the relevant matters are all determined in the first action. It was the view of the Spanish witnesses, at least on the Defendants' side, that Article 21 of the Convention was an implementation of the same principle of procedural law.\u000a
p1833
aVThe Defendants' expert accordingly reasoned that the application of Article 21 simply involved the application of the domestic Spanish law and asking what date would the Spanish court take for the purpose of assessing the priority to be given to the Quail action if an exception of \u000a
p1834
aV was raised in it by Grupo Torras. They said that the Spanish court would take the date of the issue of the proceedings. They have the clearest support for this view of the domestic Spanish law. In October 1992 the Supreme Court of Spain (civil appeal No.7557) had to decide which of two actions should be treated as the prior. One action had been filed first but the proceedings were not served until after the proceedings in the other had been both filed and served. The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of \u000a
p1835
aV could not be raised in that action.\u000a
p1836
aVHowever it is also clear, and it is accepted by the Appellants before us, that the exception cannot be taken until the proceedings in the action alleged to be the pending action (the \u000a
p1837
aVOn the findings which the Appellants accept, it is clear that the requirements of Spanish law for an action to become definitively pending are that it has been filed, accepted and served. Until all those requirements have been met, it cannot be relied upon as a - \u000a
p1838
aV confines the role of the domestic law to answering the question when were the requirements of that law for the action to have become definitively pending first fulfilled. It follows that for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention the Spanish courts did not become seized of the Quail proceedings as between the relevant parties until 1st October 1993, that is to say, a date after the date upon which the English court had, on any view, became seized of the present action as between the relevant parties, which no longer includes Mr. Nunez and Mr. Pique because of the discontinuance of the action against them.\u000a
p1839
aV had been properly raised, Spanish law treated the action as having been pending since the time of filing. There was evidence to support both these submissions as a matter of Spanish law. But they still did not advance the Appellants' case under the Convention. The test laid down in \u000a
p1840
aV test at any of the earlier stages. It may be impossible to say definitively who are going to be the parties and what are going to be the causes of action. .All these difficulties applied in the present case. But the Appellants had a further difficulty. As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted. It was not until February 1994 that they were finally admitted by an appellate court. (Currently the investigating judge is still carrying out his investigations.) Unless the Appellants can rely upon some principle of relation back, they on any view cannot succeed on this ground of appeal. But as is clearly stated in \u000a
p1841
aVThe Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors. But this still does not make the subject matter of the action the decisions of organs of Grupo Torras. The action is concerned with the Defendants' alleged misappropriation of the company's money. Grupo Torras's only role was to be the victim of the alleged conspiracy; it is impossible to accept the proposition that in misappropriating its money the alleged conspirators were acting as its agents or organs, let alone that decisions of its organs were involved.\u000a

p1844
aVThe other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras. Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras. It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement. On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa, de Mir, Nunez, Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to (among other things) the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action. This action has, for convenience, been referred to as the 'Quail' action. The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.\u000a
p1845
aVWant or excess of authority, however, is one thing, abuse of authority is quite another. Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest. But that is not the present case.\u000a

Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law.

Before us both sides challenge this conclusion. The Respondents submit, by their amended Respondents' Notice, that the Judge should have found that the Spanish courts were not seized until 1st October 1994, the date upon which Grupo Torras was served with the amended Quail proceedings; if this submission is right, the English proceedings would take priority whichever of the rival interpretations of Article 21 was to be preferred, save in the case of Mr. Nunez. When the draft judgments in this appeal were handed down the exceptional position of Mr. Nunez was not appreciated by the Court, since the argument had proceeded on the basis that all the added Quail Plaintiffs could be treated similarly. It was then pointed out that this was not so. The matter was adjourned so that the Plaintiffs could decide whether they wished to continue the action against Mr. Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted. In the result the Plaintiffs discontinued the action against him and accordingly, if the Respondents are right that the Spanish Courts were not seized of the Quail proceedings until 1st October 1993, we do not have to resolve this question. We should add that at the same time the Plaintiffs' discontinued against Mr. Pique; he is not a party to the Quail proceedings, but a question in relation to Article 22 might have arisen in his case, but for the discontinuance.\u000a

aV(1) The Spanish courts became seized on 9th June 1992 because once the Quail proceedings had been amended (on 18th May 1993) the amendment related back under Spanish procedural law to the original date of filing and the date of filing is the date upon which a Spanish court becomes under Spanish procedural law seized of an action. This way of putting their case would, if accepted, also make the Article 21 interpretation dispute academic; 9th June 1992 precedes any possible date for the English proceedings.\u000a

aV. In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made, supported by the Advocate-General, that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22, for instance, the moment the proceedings were served. The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continued:\u000a

aV15. Since the object of the Convention is not to unify those formalities, which are closely linked to the organisation of judicial procedure in the various States, the question as to the moment which the conditions for definitive seisin for the purposes of Article 21 are met must be appraised and resolved, in the case of each court, according to the rules of its own national law. That method allows each court to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty, by reference to its own national law, as regards itself, and by reference to the national law of any other court which has been seised, as regards that court, the order or priority in time of several actions brought within the conditions laid down by the Convention.\u000a

aVThe length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days. The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject (subject to an immaterial qualification) the applications of the Defendants. He held that Article 16(2) did not apply. He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21. He held that the English court was the court first seized. He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply. He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action.\u000a

aV(4)  That, if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21, or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 16(2) or 22, the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under O.li, or should stay, the remainder of the action.\u000a

aVA court other than the court first Eeised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the law of that court permits the consolidation of related actions and the court first seised has jurisdiction over both actions.\u000a

aVAs previously stated, the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized, it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions, this action in England and the criminal, guerelJa, proceedings and the Quail action in Spain.\u000a

The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'. These arguments therefore provided a strong indication of the correct application of Articles 21 and 22 and to what extent the arguments on each side were soundly based.\u000a

In October 1992 the Supreme Court of Spain (civil appeal No.7557) had to decide which of two actions should be treated as the prior. One action had been filed first but the proceedings were not served until after the proceedings in the other had been both filed and served. The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of \u000a

Other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyds, who are the second to twenty-sixth plaintiffs in action 1993 folio 440, subscribed the contracts except for those written by New Hampshire or Chubb alone. It is not possible to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendants, as there are two actions and for the most part the same parties feature on opposite sides. So we will refer to all the insurers collectively as the Insurers, and as the Other Insurers when we are excluding Chubb. The beneficiaries of the insurance contracts were on one view companies in the Maxwell group, together with some pension fund trustees, and on another the Maxwell group itself. It is the companies, or rather some of them, and the trustees who feature as parties in these actions. They have been called the Claimants. As has already been mentioned, in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone.\u000a

If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.  In consequence partly of this inconvenience and partly of the fact that insurance has always been regarded as a transaction requiring the utmost good faith between the parties in which the assured is bound to communicate to the insurer every material fact within his knowledge not only at the inception of the risk, but at every subsequent stage while it continues, up to and including the time when he makes his claim, the common law courts invented the order for ship's papers, an order which is made as soon as the writ is issued in an action on a policy of marine insurance.\u000a

aVIn the present action the focus is on Mr McHugh's creation of the Consolidator invoices with the purpose and intention stated in (2) and (5) above. The Consolidator invoices were both instructed and created prior to the renewal in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's insurances. Following my judgment on 5th July 1996, Herbert Smith by letter dated 12th August 1996 wrote announcing that ICCI and Royal Hotel had decided to avoid the material damage policy and enclosing draft points of claim identifying as the grounds non-disclosure of the matters summarized in paragraphs (1) to (5) above.\u000a
p1936
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p1937
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a

Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates.

It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a

Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss.

aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

p1976
aVIn relation to the amendment in late 1995/early 1996 of the statement of claim in the 1994 action, the affidavit said that the dishonest creation of the charges to Consolidator was pleaded simply as a particular from which fraud in the presentation of the business interruption claim could be inferred, the date of the fraud on bankers was not pleaded and Herbert Smith and insurers remained perplexed as to what precisely was RHL's case in respect of the Consolidator invoices, and for what services they had been raised. It said that from the commencement of the trial of the 1994 action it seemed sensible to wait until the Judge had decided one way or the other as to the true facts before the insurers decided to allege material non-disclosure in respect of the material damage policy. Again, no doubt, this affidavit was prepared without reference to and without having in mind the documents and account on Herbert Smith's file dating from July 1996.\u000a

aV I infer that the TSW letter had been under discussion for a little time, even though in the event it was delayed for a few days more. On behalf of the underwriters, Mr Kealey speculated that the notification to underwriters was itself a reaction to the following year insurers' unhappiness at undertaking responsibility for past pension mis-selling. Indeed Mr Kealey was prepared to infer that with new brokers in the saddle the new insurers were saying - Not in our policy! He submitted, however, that the nature of any such discussions or negotiations was irrelevant to the issues before me, even if the prospective new insurers were threatening to exclude past pension mis-selling or to weight the premium.\u000a
p1980
aV On behalf of underwriters Mr Kealey submitted that the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was invalid as a purported notice under General Condition 2 (GC2). He emphasised that the term, where it applied, afforded to the assured a valuable benefit in extending into the future the right to be indemnified by claims made subsequent to the original period of insurance but arising out of the notified circumstances. It followed, he argued, that the benefit should not be abused by an assured's attempt to seek spurious protection for the future where present circumstances did not justify the giving of a notice. The words any circumstance of which THE ASSURED shall become aware required some new knowledge on the part of JRA. The words which may give rise to a claim laid down an objective test, which required that there must be a real, or material, risk, something more than a de minimis risk, something more than a negligible, fanciful or speculative risk, that the circumstance notified may lead to a claim. Neither the KPMG report nor Lautro's letter in reaction to it justified the view that JRA had become aware of anything new which could objectively and reasonably be said to amount to such a risk. All that had been identified was a possible problem. The statistical risk that each year's pension selling might ultimately give rise to claims was nothing new, and the KPMG report was merely further statistics. In any event, it did not apply to JRA. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA to suggest that their appointed representatives were mis-selling pensions. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA that their procedures for vetting opt-outs and transfers were not working. The fact that competitors carrying on business in the same market might be susceptible to criticism in certain cases in which they, but not JRA, had been involved was irrelevant.\u000a
p1981
aVMoreover, JRA were not moved to give notice by prior warnings, such as Lautro's Enforcement Bulletin 14, which spoke of the potential problem, or EB16, which spoke to the size of the overall problem. It was probable, therefore, that the notice of 27 January 1994, coming as it did more than a month after Lautro's letter of 22 December 1993, but only a few days before the end of the current period of insurance and only a few days after the completion of a proposal form for the next year's cover, was a tactical reaction to difficulties experienced in obtaining the next year's cover rather than a genuine reaction to the KPMG report and Lautro's letter. In this connection, it was significant that there had been no witness from JRA to speak to the origins of the TSW letter.\u000a
p1982
aV Mr Symons has two answers to this. First, on the facts he submits that EB16 was different from the KPMG report and the reactions then engendered: it was primarily concerned with providing guidance for future sales. In as much as it called for a special monitoring exercise as respects existing investors, that exercise was limited to PPPs which during the third quarter of 1992 had been terminated or made paid up by investors within two years of purchase. JRA's own exercise merely showed that there were no such PPPs in their own as then short history. Secondly, as a matter of construction he submits that the last line of Exclusion 2 (or which were known to THE ASSURED prior to the inception of this Policy) and the Special Conditions are inconsistent with one another, in that the latter purport to cover, albeit limited to the amount and extent of the previous year's insurance, what the former seeks to exclude - with the result that the exclusion must make way for the express inclusion.\u000a

It followed, he argued, that the benefit should not be abused by an assured's attempt to seek spurious protection for the future where present circumstances did not justify the giving of a notice. The words any circumstance of which THE ASSURED shall become aware required some new knowledge on the part of JRA. The words which may give rise to a claim laid down an objective test, which required that there must be a real, or material, risk, something more than a de minimis risk, something more than a negligible, fanciful or speculative risk, that the circumstance notified may lead to a claim. Neither the KPMG report nor Lautro's letter in reaction to it justified the view that JRA had become aware of anything new which could objectively and reasonably be said to amount to such a risk. All that had been identified was a possible problem. The statistical risk that each year's pension selling might ultimately give rise to claims was nothing new, and the KPMG report was merely further statistics. In any event, it did not apply to JRA. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA to suggest that their appointed representatives were mis-selling pensions. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA that their procedures for vetting opt-outs and transfers were not working. The fact that competitors carrying on business in the same market might be susceptible to criticism in certain cases in which they, but not JRA, had been involved was irrelevant.\u000a

It was probable, therefore, that the notice of 27 January 1994, coming as it did more than a month after Lautro's letter of 22 December 1993, but only a few days before the end of the current period of insurance and only a few days after the completion of a proposal form for the next year's cover, was a tactical reaction to difficulties experienced in obtaining the next year's cover rather than a genuine reaction to the KPMG report and Lautro's letter. In this connection, it was significant that there had been no witness from JRA to speak to the origins of the TSW letter.\u000a
p1999
aV Mr Symons has two answers to this. First, on the facts he submits that EB16 was different from the KPMG report and the reactions then engendered: it was primarily concerned with providing guidance for future sales. In as much as it called for a special monitoring exercise as respects existing investors, that exercise was limited to PPPs which during the third quarter of 1992 had been terminated or made paid up by investors within two years of purchase. JRA's own exercise merely showed that there were no such PPPs in their own as then short history. Secondly, as a matter of construction he submits that the last line of Exclusion 2 (or which were known to THE ASSURED prior to the inception of this Policy) and the Special Conditions are inconsistent with one another, in that the latter purport to cover, albeit limited to the amount and extent of the previous year's insurance, what the former seeks to exclude - with the result that the exclusion must make way for the express inclusion.\u000a

It was probable, therefore, that the notice of 27 January 1994, coming as it did more than a month after Lautro's letter of 22 December 1993, but only a few days before the end of the current period of insurance and only a few days after the completion of a proposal form for the next year's cover, was a tactical reaction to difficulties experienced in obtaining the next year's cover rather than a genuine reaction to the KPMG report and Lautro's letter. In this connection, it was significant that there had been no witness from JRA to speak to the origins of the TSW letter.\u000a
p2019
aV Mr Symons has two answers to this. First, on the facts he submits that EB16 was different from the KPMG report and the reactions then engendered: it was primarily concerned with providing guidance for future sales. In as much as it called for a special monitoring exercise as respects existing investors, that exercise was limited to PPPs which during the third quarter of 1992 had been terminated or made paid up by investors within two years of purchase. JRA's own exercise merely showed that there were no such PPPs in their own as then short history. Secondly, as a matter of construction he submits that the last line of Exclusion 2 (or which were known to THE ASSURED prior to the inception of this Policy) and the Special Conditions are inconsistent with one another, in that the latter purport to cover, albeit limited to the amount and extent of the previous year's insurance, what the former seeks to exclude - with the result that the exclusion must make way for the express inclusion.\u000a
p2020
aV On behalf of underwriters Mr Kealey submitted that the TSW letter of 27 January 1994 was invalid as a purported notice under General Condition 2 (GC2). He emphasised that the term, where it applied, afforded to the assured a valuable benefit in extending into the future the right to be indemnified by claims made subsequent to the original period of insurance but arising out of the notified circumstances. It followed, he argued, that the benefit should not be abused by an assured's attempt to seek spurious protection for the future where present circumstances did not justify the giving of a notice. The words any circumstance of which THE ASSURED shall become aware required some new knowledge on the part of JRA. The words which may give rise to a claim laid down an objective test, which required that there must be a real, or material, risk, something more than a de minimis risk, something more than a negligible, fanciful or speculative risk, that the circumstance notified may lead to a claim. Neither the KPMG report nor Lautro's letter in reaction to it justified the view that JRA had become aware of anything new which could objectively and reasonably be said to amount to such a risk. All that had been identified was a possible problem. The statistical risk that each year's pension selling might ultimately give rise to claims was nothing new, and the KPMG report was merely further statistics. In any event, it did not apply to JRA. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA to suggest that their appointed representatives were mis-selling pensions. There was no evidence of any new knowledge on the part of JRA that their procedures for vetting opt-outs and transfers were not working. The fact that competitors carrying on business in the same market might be susceptible to criticism in certain cases in which they, but not JRA, had been involved was irrelevant.\u000a

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p2022
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one.

aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p2039
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market.

aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p2052
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one.

In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996.

It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms.

Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a

aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a

aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aVWhat would have happened had ICCI known of Royal Hotel's conduct set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) above? I think it right to formulate the question in this way. If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a

aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson.

If one asks what would have happened if Royal Hotel itself had disclosed such conduct, the very question introduces an element of frankness which was not present. Even the question I have formulated involves an opposite problem, on which I have touched above. The occasions when insurers will on placing or renewal know of an insured's dishonest conduct must be fewer than the occasions when there has in fact been such conduct. For this reason, to ask particular insurers about their attitude if they had known of particular dishonest conduct in the context of a specific insurance may risk putting a question which is somewhat loaded against the insured. In reality however most insurers will be aware that moral hazard must be a much more frequent occurrence than the occasions on which it is disclosed or detected. This still leaves the difficulty that questions of moral hazard appear commonly to arise after the event of a loss, when it is easy and insurers have every incentive to adopt a strict attitude. This difficulty is particularly acute in a case such as the present where it can be seen with hindsight that the moral hazard has in fact materialized. It is one which the court should recognize and take into account when seeking to identify what, realistically, would have been the actual insurers' reaction to the relevant conduct at the time of placing or renewal.\u000a
p2081
aVIn assessing this evidence and the extent to which ICCI has made out its case, certain other background factors require mention. Firstly, the long-term insurance agreement appears in practice to have had some impact on ICCI's attitude to the extent to which it could or should seek more stringent terms, but it was not suggested that this would have been of any real significance to its reaction to moral hazard. Secondly, no proposal was used for the present renewal. For reasons already indicated, neither this nor the other forms of proposal put to Mr Smith have however any real weight in the present context. Thirdly, Mr Walpole gave oral evidence that the population of the Channel Islands is essentially very genuine, sincere and honest. He also said that the economy had also been fairly buoyant for many years and that it was rare for an organization to be trading at a loss. This evidence contrasts somewhat with his witness statement, where he said that any inference that Royal Hotel was doing so badly that Mr McHugh had caused false documents to be created to misrepresent the truth would have been a considerable concern to him particularly in a recession (October 1991), when there was already growing concern about arson. Mr Walpole went on however to say that he had never knowingly insured a person whom he believed to be dishonest, as to do so would diminish the quality of ICCI's risk portfolio. Fourthly, the two Royal Hotel insurances represented among the larger risks in ICCI's portfolio, though the largest risk was about four or five times as large. They generated over 30,000 per annum in premium income, somewhat less than three per cent of ICCI's total premium income at the time. ICCI had built up its portfolio of business, consisting mainly of Channel Island risks and entirely of risks with some Channel Island connection, by underpricing of our products in a selective and sensitive way, best suited to the characteristics of the market. This meant that it used its local presence and appreciation of local conditions, particularly in areas such as weather, to offer lower premiums than United Kingdom companies which tended to treat the Channel Islands as another English county. Because of its size ICCI remained dependant on reinsurance, but that would not have encouraged it to regard itself as unexposed, for the obvious reason that such an attitude would have imperilled the availability of reinsurance at economic rates. Fifthly, in December 1992, during the course of events following the fires, insurers became aware of adverse comments in a DTI report affecting Mr Slater, the individual ultimately behind Royal Hotel and its group, but took no steps to avoid any of the insurances on that ground. Apparently, the report recorded the inspectors' view that the conduct of Mr Slater and another in and about the prosecution of their bid for Norwest Hoist was deplorable and showed scant respect for the responsibilities of directors of public companies and the interests of shareholders and the inspectors recommended prosecution of Mr Slater under the Companies Act 1967 ss. 27 and 33. No prosecution took place. The events in question went back, I was told, to shareholdings acquired in 1972 and a takeover in the mid-1970s; the appointment of inspectors took place in March 1977 and their report was dated 24th April 1981. Insurers' attitude when they learnt of these old events in December 1992 does not in my view furnish any guide to their likely attitude, had they known before renewal of the insurances in October 1991 of Royal Hotel's dishonest conduct involving the creation of, and the intention if and when necessary or desirable to use the Consolidator invoices relating directly to the insured hotel.\u000a
p2082
aVThe gist of Mr Bakes' account in paragraphs 47-48 was that Herbert Smith were troubled that the factual position remained unclear; a distinction was still drawn between the BCS invoices and supported by KPMG; they had formed the view that they were dealing with untrustworthy people at Royal Hotel, but they recognized a danger that they might be allowing essentially personal and instinctive reactions to get in the way of providing objective and dispassionate advice; all the relevant evidence was in Royal Hotel's hands and they knew that the burden of proving fraud was a heavy one. In these circumstances, according to paragraph 48:\u000a

aV was decided on 25th July 1994 and its effect was no doubt well known to insurance specialists like Herbert Smith. In their submissions before me, insurers did not at any point suggest that any of these requirements represented any obstacle to Royal Hotel. It is true that Herbert Smith did not go into the position with their clients in any detail until after my judgment in July 1996. That was due to their tactical decision not to advance any case of avoidance based on moral hazard in any context until the 1994 action had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It also corresponded with Mr Carter's instinctive reaction in late 1995 not to become involved in any avoidance of the material damage policy at that stage. I have no real doubt, however, that Herbert Smith considered the dishonest conduct to be, on the face of it, material and knowledge of it to be, on the face of it, something that would have precluded insurers from renewing the risk in October 1991 on the same or any terms. Is it fatal to affirmation that Herbert Smith decided for tactical reasons not to pursue any moral hazard point at that stage and so did not actually address these points with their insurer clients? Or that, once it was drawn to Mr Carter's attention in late 1995 that the moral hazard point was there to pursue, he accepted that it should be left until after judgment in the 1994 action? I do not consider that it is. A person who deliberately and for tactical reasons decides not to acquire definite knowledge of a matter which he believes it likely that he could confirm must be treated as having knowledge of that matter. This is not to introduce any conception of constructive knowledge or negligence into the present situation. It reflects Herbert Smith's awareness of the point and the deliberate nature of the tactical decision which they took for better or worse not to raise or pursue it at that stage, however good it was in fact and law. They were in effect prepared to take the risk of the position being whatever it was, and it should be treated as within their knowledge accordingly. Mr Carter was, it appears, ready to adopt a similar attitude, although the way in which the matter was put to him and the extent to which he focused on it are unclear. It seems likely that it was for these reasons that insurers did not in their evidence or submissions before me focus on the fact that materiality and inducement were not considered or confirmed with insurers or any expert until after my judgment.\u000a

aV It was contemplated that the review of past business would take firms at least two years to complete substantially and for that reason certain classes of case were to be prioritised. As is well known, the industry has been criticised for taking too long on the process, but it may be that the problems have turned out to be even larger than envisaged. The Summary continued -\u000a
p2113
aV The aim of the redress programme is to offer recompense to investors who have been disadvantaged as a result of bad advice...Investment firms should provide the redress themselves...The relationship between the review and redress process and firms' obligations under their professional indemnity insurance is important: the proposals are intended to cause no risk to firms of jeopardising their PI cover...\u000a
p2114
aV The review process was divided into a number of stages - identification of the cases in question, fact gathering, compliance assessment, loss assessment and the provision of redress where due. Redress was only to be regarded as due where the review found that there had been fault (ie a breach of rules), loss, and causation - a classical analysis. The assessment of compliance was to be addressed through four essential tests which reflected the regulatory regime: know your customer and suitability, understanding of risk, adequate information, and misleading statements.\u000a
p2115
aV There were many other papers issued by SIB and PIA over the course of the next few years defining, refining and seeking to simplify the review which member firms were undertaking, but I do not think that I need go into the details of them. It will already have appeared that the essence of the process which SIB, through Lautro/PIA, required to be conducted was the identification of transfer and opt-out investors who had suffered or would suffer loss as a result of breaches of the regulatory code of conduct governing the selling of pensions to them, and the offering of compensation, called redress, to them. The process was designed to make amends, to safeguard the reputation of the industry for the future, and to avoid the need for a multiplication of law-suits, with their attendant anxieties and costs. As is common knowledge, the process received widespread publicity.\u000a
p2116
aV There is perhaps the most fundamental of the underwriters' defences. It is an intriguing issue because my narrative of the process of review will have indicated that this was a situation where the industry went out to uncover non-compliance and to volunteer recompense, rather than the more normal situation where an assured awaits claims to which he is then forced to respond.\u000a
p2117
aV Mr Kealey on the other submitted that, save in the case of sample 4 (Mrs Kendle), there had simply been no assertion of any rights against JRA and that to find or manufacture such an assertion would be fundamentally to alter the risk being insured under a claims made policy. In such a case, JRA's conduct of the review would cause underwriters to be insuring the settlement of contingent liabilities before any claim was made. As for the suggestion that JRA could have asked their investors Do you want to make a claim?, that question, if it had been asked, would have given rise to questions as to whether under a claims made policy the solicitation of claims would have been in good faith. In any event, the purpose of the review was the provision of compensation, not the solicitation of claims. Participation in the review process was not the making of a claim.\u000a
p2118
aV Ultimately, it seems to me that I have to take an overall view of the review process and the documentation which it engendered and ask myself whether claims had been made against JRA. In my judgment the answer is to say that they had.

aV The review process was divided into a number of stages - identification of the cases in question, fact gathering, compliance assessment, loss assessment and the provision of redress where due. Redress was only to be regarded as due where the review found that there had been fault (ie a breach of rules), loss, and causation - a classical analysis. The assessment of compliance was to be addressed through four essential tests which reflected the regulatory regime: know your customer and suitability, understanding of risk, adequate information, and misleading statements.\u000a

aV Mr Kealey on the other submitted that, save in the case of sample 4 (Mrs Kendle), there had simply been no assertion of any rights against JRA and that to find or manufacture such an assertion would be fundamentally to alter the risk being insured under a claims made policy. In such a case, JRA's conduct of the review would cause underwriters to be insuring the settlement of contingent liabilities before any claim was made. As for the suggestion that JRA could have asked their investors Do you want to make a claim?, that question, if it had been asked, would have given rise to questions as to whether under a claims made policy the solicitation of claims would have been in good faith.

He said that since GRC left Dubai in 1984, despite shared business interests, he only renewed close personal contact with Mr Al Tajir in 1986 when they were both deeply involved as diplomatic go-betweens in the Lebanese peace process. At that time Mr Al Tajir spoke to him about Dubal, apparently with the authority of the Dubai government: Mr Salaam asserted that Mr Al Tajir was still Director of the Ruler's Office and of Petroleum Affairs. He recognised that his influence and presence in government affairs had waned, but that this did not apply to Dubal...where Mahdi Tajir's authority on behalf of the Dubai Government was unquestioned. Mr Al Tajir told him of his concerns for Dubal: lack of vertical integration, lack of control over its alumina supplies, the need for a fourth potline to increase production and lower costs, the lack of necessary capital, the uncertainty of long term gas supplies for the smelter's energy needs, ultimately Dubal's long term viability. Mr Al Tajir ended by asking him to investigate two things: alternative and additional gas supplies, and the feasibility of opening and running a sales agency operation in the United States.\u000a

aVWhat happened in Dubal from 1992 onwards when the Richco consultancy agreement came under question, a process which culminated in Mr Livingstone leaving Dubai in October 1992 and in Dubal giving notice to Richco of the termination of the agreement on 22 March 1993 was the phenomenon well-known in autocratic feudal regimes; namely a changing of the guard. Those around the Ruler change and the first objective of the new regime is to discredit everything done by the old one. However, it is only the players who change; the game remains the same.\u000a

aV I do not have to go into the merits or otherwise of the work performed by GRC under its contract with Dubal. Mr Salaam's evidence was to the effect that his help saved the whole project from disaster. He remains bitter to this day that GRC was forced from its position by what he regarded as the wrongful unilateral termination of the GRC management agreement, for which the compensation GRC received made but small amends. He ascribed the process by which GRC was forced from its position as Dubaisation: he said that nominally the process was put in terms of a direct request by Sheikh Hamdan, but that he always presumed at the time that Mahdi Tajir was also behind Dubaisation. \u000a

aV Mr Briggs was well placed to observe and understand the transfer of power which followed on the Ruler's illness. Mr Briggs' evidence was that as the Ruler began to involve his sons in the affairs of government following his initial stroke, so the power of Mr Al Tajir began to wain. In his view it had ceased altogether by the time of the Ruler's second devastating stroke. Mr Briggs exemplified that process by reference to a letter which he was asked by Sheikh Mohamed to approve. He was somewhat uncertain as to the date of this letter, putting it variously at November 1980, or in 1981 or early 1982, and the letter has not itself surfaced into evidence, but what Mr Briggs said about it was as follows. It was a letter written by Sheikh Mohamed to the Dubai oil company, emphasising that Mr Al Tajir no longer had any responsibility or authority for oil affairs, and that he, Sheikh Mohamed, was now in charge of such affairs. Mr Briggs also said that Mr Al Tajir's office at the Ruler's court was vacated shortly afterwards and he ceased thereafter to carry out any duties or functions on behalf of the government of Dubai. I find Mr Briggs' evidence about the vacation of Mr Al Tajir's office to be particularly significant. The official title of that office was the Office of HH the Ruler's Affairs and Petroleum Affairs. It makes sense that if Mr Al Tajir lost control of Petroleum Affairs to Sheikh Mohamed, and lost his role as representative of the Ruler, due to the Ruler's ill-health, then he would lose both his position and his physical station in the Ruler's Office at the Ruler's court. Mr Briggs' recollection was that the office was taken over by the Director of Customs and Ports in 1981. It was put to Mr Briggs on behalf of Mr Livingstone (day 2, page 75) that \u000a

aV There was another bogus option for $2.6 million arranged by Mr Livingstone in December 1988: it was Dubal who this time paid that money to Richco as the price of the option, and Clarendon in due course paid that money on to an account in Zurich for the benefit of Metal Production Consultants, a company under the control of M & F Engineering, in payment of the cost of hiring aircraft in connection with Mr Al Tajir's shuttle diplomacy in the Lebanese peace process. Mr Livingstone explained (day 10, page 38ff):\u000a

aV Thirdly, I find that the three protagonists were well used to working with one another in such a venture. They had all been involved together previously in the GRC management agreement, and had all received financial benefits out of it. Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone appear to have remained close associates throughout the period which this judgment covers, even down to today. Mr Livingstone had been a director of GRC during the period of the GRC management agreement. Following Mr Livingstone's departure from Dubal and Dubai, Mr Salaam was able to offer him a consultancy appointment with GRC. They still play golf together, at any rate up to the recent past. Similarly, there was a business partnership of a kind between Mr Salaam and Mr Al Tajir, and they were working together at the material time on the Lebanon peace process. Furthermore, it is clear from Mr Livingstone's and Mr Strothotte's evidence that Mr Livingstone was prepared to act on behalf of Mr Al Tajir (and Mr Salaam) for instance in negotiating further payments from Richco. He was also trusted by both Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam in resolving the claims of Mr Saad Salaam. Where trust to a common end might be necessary, the three knew each other well and could obviously work together.\u000a

aV First, like Mr Livingstone, he knew that Mr Al Tajir no longer had authority from Dubal or the Ruler to legitimise the scheme. He knew Mr Al Tajir well: he had been and remained business partners with him in various ventures, and was cooperating with him in the diplomatic missions arising from the Lebanese peace process. I cannot accept that Mr Al Tajir would have sought to lead Mr Salaam into the belief, or leave him disabused in the belief, that he retained his former role within the government of Dubai or in the affairs of Dubal. In any event, the unwinding of the GRC management agreement would have taught Mr Salaam the very pertinent truth of Mr Al Tajir's waning influence. If Mr Al Tajir had remained in power, there was no reason why the GRC agreement could not have continued as before. On top of all that, Sheikh Mohamed had told Mr Salaam to his face in March 1983 that Mr Al Tajir's ways of business are over. I have already made the point above that Mr Salaam's evidence in relation to that meeting was unsatisfactory. It follows that Mr Salaam, like Mr Livingstone, has based his case on the false defence that the scheme was authorised by Mr Al Tajir.

aV Mr Salaam traced the origins of the scheme to Mr Al Tajir himself. He said that since GRC left Dubai in 1984, despite shared business interests, he only renewed close personal contact with Mr Al Tajir in 1986 when they were both deeply involved as diplomatic go-betweens in the Lebanese peace process. At that time Mr Al Tajir spoke to him about Dubal, apparently with the authority of the Dubai government: Mr Salaam asserted that Mr Al Tajir was still Director of the Ruler's Office and of Petroleum Affairs. He recognised that his influence and presence in government affairs had waned, but that this did not apply to Dubal...where Mahdi Tajir's authority on behalf of the Dubai Government was unquestioned. Mr Al Tajir told him of his concerns for Dubal: lack of vertical integration, lack of control over its alumina supplies, the need for a fourth potline to increase production and lower costs, the lack of necessary capital, the uncertainty of long term gas supplies for the smelter's energy needs, ultimately Dubal's long term viability. Mr Al Tajir ended by asking him to investigate two things: alternative and additional gas supplies, and the feasibility of opening and running a sales agency operation in the United States.\u000a

aV Mr Briggs was well placed to observe and understand the transfer of power which followed on the Ruler's illness. Mr Briggs' evidence was that as the Ruler began to involve his sons in the affairs of government following his initial stroke, so the power of Mr Al Tajir began to wain. In his view it had ceased altogether by the time of the Ruler's second devastating stroke. Mr Briggs exemplified that process by reference to a letter which he was asked by Sheikh Mohamed to approve. He was somewhat uncertain as to the date of this letter, putting it variously at November 1980, or in 1981 or early 1982, and the letter has not itself surfaced into evidence, but what Mr Briggs said about it was as follows. It was a letter written by Sheikh Mohamed to the Dubai oil company, emphasising that Mr Al Tajir no longer had any responsibility or authority for oil affairs, and that he, Sheikh Mohamed, was now in charge of such affairs. Mr Briggs also said that Mr Al Tajir's office at the Ruler's court was vacated shortly afterwards and he ceased thereafter to carry out any duties or functions on behalf of the government of Dubai. I find Mr Briggs' evidence about the vacation of Mr Al Tajir's office to be particularly significant. The official title of that office was the Office of HH the Ruler's Affairs and Petroleum Affairs. It makes sense that if Mr Al Tajir lost control of Petroleum Affairs to Sheikh Mohamed, and lost his role as representative of the Ruler, due to the Ruler's ill-health, then he would lose both his position and his physical station in the Ruler's Office at the Ruler's court. Mr Briggs' recollection was that the office was taken over by the Director of Customs and Ports in 1981. It was put to Mr Briggs on behalf of Mr Livingstone (day 2, page 75) that \u000a

aV Thirdly, I find that the three protagonists were well used to working with one another in such a venture. They had all been involved together previously in the GRC management agreement, and had all received financial benefits out of it. Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone appear to have remained close associates throughout the period which this judgment covers, even down to today. Mr Livingstone had been a director of GRC during the period of the GRC management agreement. Following Mr Livingstone's departure from Dubal and Dubai, Mr Salaam was able to offer him a consultancy appointment with GRC. They still play golf together, at any rate up to the recent past. Similarly, there was a business partnership of a kind between Mr Salaam and Mr Al Tajir, and they were working together at the material time on the Lebanon peace process. Furthermore, it is clear from Mr Livingstone's and Mr Strothotte's evidence that Mr Livingstone was prepared to act on behalf of Mr Al Tajir (and Mr Salaam) for instance in negotiating further payments from Richco. He was also trusted by both Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam in resolving the claims of Mr Saad Salaam. Where trust to a common end might be necessary, the three knew each other well and could obviously work together.\u000a
p2196
aV First, like Mr Livingstone, he knew that Mr Al Tajir no longer had authority from Dubal or the Ruler to legitimise the scheme. He knew Mr Al Tajir well: he had been and remained business partners with him in various ventures, and was cooperating with him in the diplomatic missions arising from the Lebanese peace process. I cannot accept that Mr Al Tajir would have sought to lead Mr Salaam into the belief, or leave him disabused in the belief, that he retained his former role within the government of Dubai or in the affairs of Dubal. In any event, the unwinding of the GRC management agreement would have taught Mr Salaam the very pertinent truth of Mr Al Tajir's waning influence. If Mr Al Tajir had remained in power, there was no reason why the GRC agreement could not have continued as before. On top of all that, Sheikh Mohamed had told Mr Salaam to his face in March 1983 that Mr Al Tajir's ways of business are over. I have already made the point above that Mr Salaam's evidence in relation to that meeting was unsatisfactory. It follows that Mr Salaam, like Mr Livingstone, has based his case on the false defence that the scheme was authorised by Mr Al Tajir. The falsity of that defence is in itself strong evidence of dishonesty.\u000a

aV I do not have to go into the merits or otherwise of the work performed by GRC under its contract with Dubal. Mr Salaam's evidence was to the effect that his help saved the whole project from disaster. He remains bitter to this day that GRC was forced from its position by what he regarded as the wrongful unilateral termination of the GRC management agreement, for which the compensation GRC received made but small amends. He ascribed the process by which GRC was forced from its position as Dubaisation: he said that nominally the process was put in terms of a direct request by Sheikh Hamdan, but that he always presumed at the time that Mahdi Tajir was also behind Dubaisation. \u000a

He remains bitter to this day that GRC was forced from its position by what he regarded as the wrongful unilateral termination of the GRC management agreement, for which the compensation GRC received made but small amends. He ascribed the process by which GRC was forced from its position as Dubaisation: he said that nominally the process was put in terms of a direct request by Sheikh Hamdan, but that he always presumed at the time that Mahdi Tajir was also behind Dubaisation. \u000a

aV Mr Briggs was well placed to observe and understand the transfer of power which followed on the Ruler's illness. Mr Briggs' evidence was that as the Ruler began to involve his sons in the affairs of government following his initial stroke, so the power of Mr Al Tajir began to wain. In his view it had ceased altogether by the time of the Ruler's second devastating stroke. Mr Briggs exemplified that process by reference to a letter which he was asked by Sheikh Mohamed to approve. He was somewhat uncertain as to the date of this letter, putting it variously at November 1980, or in 1981 or early 1982, and the letter has not itself surfaced into evidence, but what Mr Briggs said about it was as follows. It was a letter written by Sheikh Mohamed to the Dubai oil company, emphasising that Mr Al Tajir no longer had any responsibility or authority for oil affairs, and that he, Sheikh Mohamed, was now in charge of such affairs. Mr Briggs also said that Mr Al Tajir's office at the Ruler's court was vacated shortly afterwards and he ceased thereafter to carry out any duties or functions on behalf of the government of Dubai. I find Mr Briggs' evidence about the vacation of Mr Al Tajir's office to be particularly significant. The official title of that office was the Office of HH the Ruler's Affairs and Petroleum Affairs. It makes sense that if Mr Al Tajir lost control of Petroleum Affairs to Sheikh Mohamed, and lost his role as representative of the Ruler, due to the Ruler's ill-health, then he would lose both his position and his physical station in the Ruler's Office at the Ruler's court. Mr Briggs' recollection was that the office was taken over by the Director of Customs and Ports in 1981. It was put to Mr Briggs on behalf of Mr Livingstone (day 2, page 75) that \u000a

aV Mr Salaam traced the origins of the scheme to Mr Al Tajir himself. He said that since GRC left Dubai in 1984, despite shared business interests, he only renewed close personal contact with Mr Al Tajir in 1986 when they were both deeply involved as diplomatic go-betweens in the Lebanese peace process. At that time Mr Al Tajir spoke to him about Dubal, apparently with the authority of the Dubai government: Mr Salaam asserted that Mr Al Tajir was still Director of the Ruler's Office and of Petroleum Affairs. He recognised that his influence and presence in government affairs had waned, but that this did not apply to Dubal...where Mahdi Tajir's authority on behalf of the Dubai Government was unquestioned. Mr Al Tajir told him of his concerns for Dubal: lack of vertical integration, lack of control over its alumina supplies, the need for a fourth potline to increase production and lower costs, the lack of necessary capital, the uncertainty of long term gas supplies for the smelter's energy needs, ultimately Dubal's long term viability. Mr Al Tajir ended by asking him to investigate two things: alternative and additional gas supplies, and the feasibility of opening and running a sales agency operation in the United States.\u000a
p2227
aV There was another bogus option for $2.6 million arranged by Mr Livingstone in December 1988: it was Dubal who this time paid that money to Richco as the price of the option, and Clarendon in due course paid that money on to an account in Zurich for the benefit of Metal Production Consultants, a company under the control of M & F Engineering, in payment of the cost of hiring aircraft in connection with Mr Al Tajir's shuttle diplomacy in the Lebanese peace process. Mr Livingstone explained (day 10, page 38ff):\u000a
p2228
aV Thirdly, I find that the three protagonists were well used to working with one another in such a venture. They had all been involved together previously in the GRC management agreement, and had all received financial benefits out of it. Mr Salaam and Mr Livingstone appear to have remained close associates throughout the period which this judgment covers, even down to today. Mr Livingstone had been a director of GRC during the period of the GRC management agreement. Following Mr Livingstone's departure from Dubal and Dubai, Mr Salaam was able to offer him a consultancy appointment with GRC. They still play golf together, at any rate up to the recent past. Similarly, there was a business partnership of a kind between Mr Salaam and Mr Al Tajir, and they were working together at the material time on the Lebanon peace process. Furthermore, it is clear from Mr Livingstone's and Mr Strothotte's evidence that Mr Livingstone was prepared to act on behalf of Mr Al Tajir (and Mr Salaam) for instance in negotiating further payments from Richco. He was also trusted by both Mr Al Tajir and Mr Salaam in resolving the claims of Mr Saad Salaam. Where trust to a common end might be necessary, the three knew each other well and could obviously work together.\u000a
p2229
aV First, like Mr Livingstone, he knew that Mr Al Tajir no longer had authority from Dubal or the Ruler to legitimise the scheme. He knew Mr Al Tajir well: he had been and remained business partners with him in various ventures, and was cooperating with him in the diplomatic missions arising from the Lebanese peace process. I cannot accept that Mr Al Tajir would have sought to lead Mr Salaam into the belief, or leave him disabused in the belief, that he retained his former role within the government of Dubai or in the affairs of Dubal. In any event, the unwinding of the GRC management agreement would have taught Mr Salaam the very pertinent truth of Mr Al Tajir's waning influence. If Mr Al Tajir had remained in power, there was no reason why the GRC agreement could not have continued as before. On top of all that, Sheikh Mohamed had told Mr Salaam to his face in March 1983 that Mr Al Tajir's ways of business are over. I have already made the point above that Mr Salaam's evidence in relation to that meeting was unsatisfactory. It follows that Mr Salaam, like Mr Livingstone, has based his case on the false defence that the scheme was authorised by Mr Al Tajir. The falsity of that defence is in itself strong evidence of dishonesty.\u000a

aV Mr Salaam traced the origins of the scheme to Mr Al Tajir himself. He said that since GRC left Dubai in 1984, despite shared business interests, he only renewed close personal contact with Mr Al Tajir in 1986 when they were both deeply involved as diplomatic go-betweens in the Lebanese peace process.

aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a

Mr Anquetil sought to say that reference in his previous statement to his being instructed by Mr McHugh to raise some invoices to Consolidator had not been significant, that he could not remember Mr McHugh's actual words and that it was he who drafted the invoices and by them allocated charges within existing room categories.

aVThere can be no real doubt but that the primary commercial and legal concern in November 1994 must have been the current litigation to forfeit benefit under the business interruption policy. The material damage award had left insurers dissatisfied, but it had been paid. This was certainly Mr Carter's attitude when, a year later, the possibility of avoidance of the material damage policy was first discussed with him by Mr Higgins. He was very cool towards the suggestion, because they had already paid. Further, the material damage policy was until February 1996 only mentioned in the points of counterclaim in the 1994 action in the context of the counterclaim for conspiracy; all the same, it would hardly have been practicable to have sought to supplement the existing forfeiture by avoidance of the business interruption policy for moral hazard, without at the same time either avoiding the material damage policy or, if there was no such avoidance, gravely prejudicing any future attempt to avoid it. Mr Bakes did not think that the matter was thought through in quite that way; the focus, he said, was very much on the material damage policy so I do not recall consciously going through that thought process. It seems to me that it would be surprising if it did not play a part, consciously or instinctively, in the thinking of the highly experienced litigators handling and discussing this matter in November 1994 and subsequently.\u000a

aVMiss Bucknall's short point is that insurers should have raised any case based on avoidance of the material damage policy, or for that matter the business interruption policy, in the 1994 action, if they wanted to do so at all. They are, she submitted precluded on grounds of estoppel or abuse of process from doing so subsequently. This point was argued before me on the basis that, if it was otherwise well founded, it would be open to me to give effect to it as a defence in so far as it involves a defence or as a ground for striking out the action if and in so far as that is the appropriate remedy in a case of abuse of process.\u000a

aVIn my judgment, awareness of the issues which were bound to arise and have indeed arisen in this litigation has had a strong sub-conscious effect in shaping this evidence. In the light of the documentation, the oral evidence and cross-examination and the inherent probabilities, I find myself unable to place any real reliance on what is said in the witness statement in relation to the thought processes which determined the attitude adopted in and after November 1994. I also consider it probable that the descriptions given of the state of mind of those directing the litigation at previous dates portray a greater incomprehension and uncertainty that is likely to have been the case. Putting aside hindsight, it seems to me that on any objective view every successive development during the course of 1993 and 1994 reinforced the cause, first for suspicion, then for belief and finally for assurance that the Consolidator charges were both fictitious and dishonestly prepared, despite Royal Hotel's denials.\u000a
