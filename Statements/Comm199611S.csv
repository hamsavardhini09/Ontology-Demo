Statement:ID
 Mr Rokison for the Other Insurers argues that the insured was the Maxwell group. That was not, of course, a legal entity. Nor were its limits readily identifiable, except to the cognoscenti at headquarters. There were a number of planks in Mr Rokison's platform.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
 The origin of the order to ships' papers goes back to the time of Lord Mansfield. In those days the courts of common law did not give discovery of documents. If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.  In consequence partly of this inconvenience and partly of the fact that insurance has always been regarded as a transaction requiring the utmost good faith between the parties in which the assured is bound to communicate to the insurer every material fact within his knowledge not only at the inception of the risk, but at every subsequent stage while it continues, up to and including the time when he makes his claim, the common law courts invented the order for ship's papers, an order which is made as soon as the writ is issued in an action on a policy of marine insurance.
 this court had to consider what system of law should determine who had the better title to some shares in Berlitz International Inc., a New York Corporation. The facts in that case, either proved or assumed, were as follows: Macmillan (the 11th defendants in one of the present actions) were a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxwell Communications Corporation plc, a company owned partly by the public and partly by Mr Robert Maxwell and his family; they had a majority holding in the shares of Berlitz; those shares were transferred out of Macmillan's name to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, who were owned and controlled by Mr Maxwell and his family; and then the shares were pledged to secure the debts of companies in the private ownership of Mr Maxwell and his family. Thus Macmillan suffered a loss and those latter companies received a gain, unless and until Macmillan succeed in recovering the shares or (since they have now been sold by agreement) their value.
 We have referred to that case merely as a possible illustration of the problem that we face in the present appeals. We are being asked to answer preliminary issues, which Waller J. ordered to be tried in two actions in the Commercial Court. That was no doubt a very sensible procedure. But it is sometimes helpful to us to have some live facts to bear in mind, rather than the dry bones of a preliminary issue.
New Hampshire were the leading underwriters on all contracts, except for the top Â£10 million layers in 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, which were subscribed only by Chubb Insurance Company of Europe SA. Other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyds, who are the second to twenty-sixth plaintiffs in action 1993 folio 440, subscribed the contracts except for those written by New Hampshire or Chubb alone. It is not possible to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendants, as there are two actions and for the most part the same parties feature on opposite sides. So we will refer to all the insurers collectively as the Insurers, and as the Other Insurers when we are excluding Chubb. The beneficiaries of the insurance contracts were on one view companies in the Maxwell group, together with some pension fund trustees, and on another the Maxwell group itself. It is the companies, or rather some of them, and the trustees who feature as parties in these actions. They have been called the Claimants. As has already been mentioned, in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him.

 Potter J had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt that there were likely to be situations whereby an officer of Company A, as well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the affairs of Company C and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or obligations of good faith in respect of all three. We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.

If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.

 (1947) KB 685 as authority for the proposition that a trade union can be a party to a contract of insurance. However that may be, we do not see that something called a group can be a party to a contract, otherwise than as a contract with all of its members. See 
 Liability of unincorporated associations. An unincorporated association is not a legal person and therefore cannot sue or be sued unless such a course is authorised by express or implied statutory provisions as in the case of a trade union and a trustee savings bank. Nor can a contract be made so as to bind all persons who from time to time become members of such an association. But a contract purportedly made by or with an incorporated association is not necessarily a nullity. If the person or persons who actually made the contract had no authority to contract on behalf of the members they may be held to have contracted personally. On the other hand, if they had the authority, express or implied, of all or some of the members of the association to contract on their behalf, the contract can be enforced by or against those members as co-principals to the contract by the ordinary rules of agency.
 (1) Nothing is relevant unless it was known to, or reasonably capable of being known to, both parties at the time when the contract was made. In particular, an undisclosed intention held 
 (1992) 1 Ll R.7. But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties. In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it is rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy. That is not this case. Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to. The insurers cannot preempt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it. That was the reasoning of Potter J., and we agree with it. He also had something to say about the operations of Lloyd's Policy Signing Office, but with that we are not concerned in this case.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him.

 We suppose that point (1) can perhaps be described as a surrounding circumstance. At all events, we ruled that evidence of it was admissible when the dispute was last before this court, although that may have been a rather generous view. We have a good deal more doubt about the admissibility of points (2) and (3). But that only mattered when we were considering whether to save the parties from unnecessary expense and the judge from unnecessary labour by excluding evidence from the start. All that is now of importance is to say, as we do, that nothing in points (1), (2) and (3) is of any assistance in helping us to decide whether the insured were the companies identified or described in the wording, or else the Maxwell Group.
 (1947) KB 685 as authority for the proposition that a trade union can be a party to a contract of insurance. However that may be, we do not see that something called a group can be a party to a contract, otherwise than as a contract with all of its members. See 
 Fraud is not something absolute, existing in vacuo; it is a fraud upon someone. A man who tries to cheat his underwriters fails if they find him out, but how does his wrong against them invest them with new rights against innocent strangers to it?
It is said that disclosure would be of value to an insurer when he has an unfettered right to cancel; hence there is a continuing duty of disclosure. The argument cannot, as we see it, be anything less than that the duty applies on every day of the policy period, to every material circumstance which becomes known to the insured. However, we suppose that if the new circumstance were something which led to a loss within fifteen days, it could be said that it was not material as the insurer would have no effective opportunity to cancel. 
 duty of disclosure is by the insured, and that it only applies before the contract is concluded (which could no doubt include the new contract which is made upon renewal). But the maxim that mention of one of two things excludes the other must be applied with caution when considering the draftsmanship of Sir Mackenzie Chalmers. His method of codification was, at any rate at times, to state the effect of rules decided by the courts, and not to pronounce upon points which had not been decided. 
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
 (b) to obtain financial benefit for the Employee, or for any other person or organisation intended by the Employee to receive such benefit, other than salaries, commissions, fees, bonuses, promotions, awards, profit sharing, pensions or other employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment.
We do not see that this diversity of expressions is of any assistance to Mr Rokison in showing that the insured meant the Maxwell Group. The policy is not by any means written with the precision of an equity draftsman. Indeed we strongly suspect that it was not written by one person at all or at one time. It seems more likely that a number of hands have added or amended passages in it from time to time.
 At this point we feel that one should sit back and examine what we mean by the insured in an insurance contract. The expression in our view covers two aspects of the person described. First, he is the person with whom the insurer contracts, the party who is bound as such. Secondly he is the person who is interested in the property or other event covered by the insurance, and whose loss is to be made good if it occurs. For the first capacity the insured must, as it seems to us, be a natural or legal person. Mr Phillips referred us to the case of 
 Liability of unincorporated associations. An unincorporated association is not a legal person and therefore cannot sue or be sued unless such a course is authorised by express or implied statutory provisions as in the case of a trade union and a trustee savings bank. Nor can a contract be made so as to bind all persons who from time to time become members of such an association. But a contract purportedly made by or with an incorporated association is not necessarily a nullity. If the person or persons who actually made the contract had no authority to contract on behalf of the members they may be held to have contracted personally. On the other hand, if they had the authority, express or implied, of all or some of the members of the association to contract on their behalf, the contract can be enforced by or against those members as co-principals to the contract by the ordinary rules of agency.
 It may well be that, when two persons are jointly insured and their interests are inseparably connected so that a loss or gain necessarily affects them both, the misconduct of one is sufficient to contaminate the whole insurance: Phillips on Marine Insurance, vol.i., at 235. But in this case there is no difficulty in separating the interest of the mortgagee from that of the owner.
 A policy issued to many persons will amount to several insurance if the persons insured have different interests in the subject matter of the insurance.
 That there can be a joint insurance by persons having a joint interest is, of course, manifest. If A and B are joint owners of property - and I use that phrase in the strict sense - an undertaking to indemnify them jointly is a true contract of indemnity in respect of a joint loss which they have jointly suffered. Again, there can be no objection to combining in one insurance a number of persons having different interests in the subject-matter of the insurance, but I find myself unable to see how an insurance of that character can be called a joint insurance. In such a case the interest of each of the insured is different. The amount of his loss, if the subject-matter of the insurance is destroyed or damaged, depends on the nature of his interest, and the covenant of indemnity which the policy gives must, in such a case, necessarily operate as a covenant to indemnify in respect of each individual different loss which the various persons named may suffer. In such a case there is no joint element at all.
. That, it is true, was not a case of non-disclosure but of wilful misconduct by one of two persons insured. But in our opinion the principle that the innocent party can still recover if it is a separate insurance must equally apply.
any other person or organisation.
 The Company's total liability (a) under Insuring Agreement 1 for all loss caused by any Employee or in which such Employee is concerned or implicated or (b) under Insuring Agreement V for all loss by forgery or alteration or in which such person is concerned or implicated ... is limited to the applicable amount of insurance specified in the Table of Limits of Liability or endorsement amendatory thereto.The liability of the Company for loss sustained by any or all of the Insured shall not exceed the amount for which the Company would be liable had all such loss been sustained by any one of the Insured.
 With respect to loss caused by any person (whether one of the Employees or not) or in which such person is concerned or implicated or which is chargeable to any Employee as provided in Section 4 and which occurs partly during the Policy Period and partly during the period of other bonds or policies issued by the Company to the Insured or to any predecessor in interest of the insured and terminated or cancelled or allowed to expire and in which the period for discovery has not expired at the time any such loss thereunder is discovered, the total liability of the Company under this Policy and under such other bonds or policies shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount carried under the applicable Insuring Agreement of this Policy on such loss or the amount available to the Insured under such other bonds or policies, as limited by the terms and conditions thereof, for any such loss, if the latter amount be the larger.
 All loss caused by acts committed by any person or in which such person is concerned or implicated and/or arising from any one occurrence (as set forth in Section II of the policy) will be considered a single loss for the purpose of this endorsement. If a loss is covered in part under this

 (4) Evidence of negotiations is not admissible. This is subject to some exceptions, such as a case of rectification, or if it is said that agreement was reached in negotiations as to the meaning of a particular term, or that the contract was made by a continuous process of agreeing some terms and then turning to consider others.
 The process started with a quotation dated 2nd July 1990. Against the printed word 
 Secondly it was submitted that, once a policy has been issued, its terms are conclusive evidence of the contract between the parties unless and until it is altered by the process of rectification. That can happen by agreement of the parties or by order of a court but not otherwise. And there has been no application for rectification in this case.
 Pergamon Group plc etc. On the other hand there is cover against loss through forgery of any cheque or bill of exchange
 (1) the title of the Insured as stated in Item 1 of the Declarations is changed to read as follows:
That seems to us the high point of Mr Rokison's argument, although it also detracts from his submissions relating to Year 1 and Year 2. As usual there is the problem with alterations, did the parties mean to clarify what they had said previously or to change it?
 this court had to consider what system of law should determine who had the better title to some shares in Berlitz International Inc., a New York Corporation. The facts in that case, either proved or assumed, were as follows: Macmillan (the 11th defendants in one of the present actions) were a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxwell Communications Corporation plc, a company owned partly by the public and partly by Mr Robert Maxwell and his family; they had a majority holding in the shares of Berlitz; those shares were transferred out of Macmillan's name to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, who were owned and controlled by Mr Maxwell and his family; and then the shares were pledged to secure the debts of companies in the private ownership of Mr Maxwell and his family. Thus Macmillan suffered a loss and those latter companies received a gain, unless and until Macmillan succeed in recovering the shares or (since they have now been sold by agreement) their value.
 We have referred to that case merely as a possible illustration of the problem that we face in the present appeals. We are being asked to answer preliminary issues, which Waller J. ordered to be tried in two actions in the Commercial Court. That was no doubt a very sensible procedure. But it is sometimes helpful to us to have some live facts to bear in mind, rather than the dry bones of a preliminary issue.
 Before the judge there was a good deal of evidence, both oral and in witness statements, by witnesses of fact and an expert. There was also some contest as to what was relevant and admissible on the topic of interpretation of the contracts, followed by an interlocutory appeal to this court comprising Staughton, Millett and Ward LJJ. In extempore judgments delivered on 15th June 1995 it is said that there was some slight divergence of view between them, and that Staughton LJ represented the middle ground. At all events the parties have been content to rely on that judgment. We would reiterate the four principles which it proposed relating to the material that is relevant to the interpretation of a written contract:
 The subsequent conduct referred to in (iv) was confined to the facts which we have already set out.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
 The field of insurance may well be one where it is normal practice to make a preliminary contract, and then for one party (the insurers) to send detailed terms to the other, not expecting a reply unless the other regards them as unsatisfactory. This may be what happens in ordinary life with motor insurance or householder's comprehensive insurance. Often the necessary acceptance can be inferred when the insured, having received the proposed policy, pays the premium. We enquired whether that was a possible answer in the present case, but it seems that no such argument was put forward before the judge and the facts found in relation to the premium are insufficient.
 We have not been told that there was any evidence of a custom in the insurance industry that policy details are accepted unless they are expressly questioned. Nor does there appear to have been any contention to that effect; it was merely said to be the usual practice as between Chubb and brokers. The judge did not regard the evidence of that as reliable. So we must consider the particular relationship and the particular circumstances of this case. We cannot attribute much, or indeed any, weight to the fact that Mr Ward wrote checked & okay on the letter, and put the policy in the place where original policies were kept; those were not circumstances which by inference conveyed acceptance to Chubb, since they did not know of them. Furthermore Mr Ward was a subordinate member of the Risk Management Department, under Mr Cox who was the head of it and whose task it was to review the primary policy wordings.
 The origin of the order to ships' papers goes back to the time of Lord Mansfield. In those days the courts of common law did not give discovery of documents. If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.  In consequence partly of this inconvenience and partly of the fact that insurance has always been regarded as a transaction requiring the utmost good faith between the parties in which the assured is bound to communicate to the insurer every material fact within his knowledge not only at the inception of the risk, but at every subsequent stage while it continues, up to and including the time when he makes his claim, the common law courts invented the order for ship's papers, an order which is made as soon as the writ is issued in an action on a policy of marine insurance.
 What the underwriter was seeking to do in these two cases was to fix upon the assured a duty to volunteer information ex post facto concerning new matter, which had come to light after the conclusion of the policy, and which affected the risk already accepted. The key to these cases is I think to be found in the dictum of Lord Buckmaster in the Niger case that there is no duty on the assured to disclose circumstances arising subsequently which might show that the premium had been accepted at too low a rate. This in my judgment does not touch the problem with which the Court is concerned in the present case.
 There is no duty to disclose matters relevant to the making of the contract once the contract had been made; the time has then passed within which they must be disclosed. The later disclosure of later discovered facts would serve no useful purpose and, therefore, is not required. By contrast there can be situations which arise subsequently where the duty of utmost good faith makes it necessary that there should be further disclosure because the relevant facts are relevant to the later stages of the contract. The 
 The plaintiff seeks to strike out pars 15 to 16 inclusive of the first defendant's amended defence. In essence, by those paragraphs, the first defendant, an insurer, seeks to avoid liability under a policy of insurance on the basis that, during the currency of the policy the insured failed to comply with its obligation to act in good faith by failing to disclose certain material facts. It is claimed by the insurer that the disclosure of the facts was required by it in order to enable it to exercise two alternatives which were available to it. First, under condition D(v), the insurer had the opportunity of giving thirty days notice to terminate the policy. Secondly, it had the opportunity throughout of obtaining facultative reinsurance. It is said that the disclosures, if made, would have borne materially on a decision whether or not either or both of these opportunities should be availed of.
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
, this Court ought to extend (at least, so I understood him) the doctrine so as to meet a case of this kind, in order that the Underwriters should have the opportunity of giving the three months' notice when in fact the character or extent of the risk had altered. We asked him to formulate what the effect of introducing such a doctrine would be, and I think he must have felt himself in a difficulty in doing that, but ultimately I understood him to say that, if there was non-disclosure and an alteration of risk while the contract was a continuing contract, the Underwriter would have the right to exercise the option retrospectively when he became aware of the facts, as from the time when the disclosure ought to have been made, or alternatively, the contract should be treated as automatically concluded at the expiration of three months from that time. Well, I think that the statement of the consequences, which Mr Leslie Scott desires, indicate that this is not a case in which the doctrine can or ought to be applied. It may be that the Underwriters did not appreciate the difference in their position which they were making by the alteration in the form of the contract, and all I can say is that, if people enter into contracts of insurance for long periods, it would be a wise precaution to insert some provision requiring notice to be given them if the nature of the risk does alter or vary appreciably.
 have been saying, as Mr Rokison submits, that the existence of such a duty would on the facts have been of no avail to the insurers in that particular case. But that does not detract from his view that there was no continuing duty.
 It would appear to me that in some of the arguments addressed to your Lordships on behalf of the underwriters, the fact has not been kept in mind that the cover is by the terms of the slip I have read a continuous cover, not limited in duration, save by the fact that it may be terminated by three months' notice. I for myself beg to say that I can see no reason why the principle laid down in the cases I have cited as to the disclosure by the assured of material facts between the signing of the cover and the issue of the policy should not apply to the continuous cover created in this case.
 We shall explain why we adopt the Restatement rule. That rule provides that each time the creditor accepts the continuing offer of a surety on a continuing guaranty by extending further credit to the principal debtor, the creditor owes a duty to the surety to disclose facts known by the creditor if the creditor has reason to believe that those facts materially increase the risk beyond that which the surety intended to assume and that those facts are unknown to the surety. (Rest., Security 124. subd.(1), com. c. pp. 327-328,330.)

Thus Macmillan suffered a loss and those latter companies received a gain, unless and until Macmillan succeed in recovering the shares or (since they have now been sold by agreement) their value.

New Hampshire were the leading underwriters on all contracts, except for the top Â£10 million layers in 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, which were subscribed only by Chubb Insurance Company of Europe SA. Other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyds, who are the second to twenty-sixth plaintiffs in action 1993 folio 440, subscribed the contracts except for those written by New Hampshire or Chubb alone. It is not possible to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendants, as there are two actions and for the most part the same parties feature on opposite sides. So we will refer to all the insurers collectively as the Insurers, and as the Other Insurers when we are excluding Chubb. The beneficiaries of the insurance contracts were on one view companies in the Maxwell group, together with some pension fund trustees, and on another the Maxwell group itself. It is the companies, or rather some of them, and the trustees who feature as parties in these actions. They have been called the Claimants. As has already been mentioned, in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone.

 Potter J had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt that there were likely to be situations whereby an officer of Company A, as well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the affairs of Company C and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or obligations of good faith in respect of all three. We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.

 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
 The pleading of Chubb as to how the two policies came to form part of the contracts is distinctly vague, and there was no request for Further and Better Particulars. But Mr Phillips on their behalf put his case in three ways. First he submitted that, when each of the slips was initialled by Chubb, it was implied in the terms thereby agreed that the Chubb Follow Form was part of the contract.
 We cannot accept that argument, if only for the reason that the implication would contradict the express terms of the contract. Each of the slips referred to a form; in our experience that is extremely common if not universal practice. In neither case was it the Chubb form. In those circumstances it cannot in our judgment be implied that the Chubb form was required by the contract that was concluded when the slips were initialled.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
 form part of the contracts? Apparently the parties agreed that there was no need for any amendments, at any rate for the time being. We do not feel that we should tolerate such a cavalier attitude. The Claimants should be required to amend their pleadings so as to delete assertions which they now themselves contradict.
 Next, as point (4), Mr Rokison relies on the use of the words and/or in the description of the Insured. Did it mean that Pergamon Holdings Ltd 
 Liability of unincorporated associations. An unincorporated association is not a legal person and therefore cannot sue or be sued unless such a course is authorised by express or implied statutory provisions as in the case of a trade union and a trustee savings bank. Nor can a contract be made so as to bind all persons who from time to time become members of such an association. But a contract purportedly made by or with an incorporated association is not necessarily a nullity. If the person or persons who actually made the contract had no authority to contract on behalf of the members they may be held to have contracted personally. On the other hand, if they had the authority, express or implied, of all or some of the members of the association to contract on their behalf, the contract can be enforced by or against those members as co-principals to the contract by the ordinary rules of agency.
 In the light of our conclusion on issue (F), the answer to this question is in our judgment, No. Technically one ought to enquire whether for each layer in each year there was one contract, or as many contracts as there were companies insured. And if the former, can a contract be avoided for non-disclosure as against one or some of the insured, but not against others? We feel that we are relieved from the need to answer those questions by the authority of the House of Lords, in the passage already quoted from 
It is said that disclosure would be of value to an insurer when he has an unfettered right to cancel; hence there is a continuing duty of disclosure. The argument cannot, as we see it, be anything less than that the duty applies on every day of the policy period, to every material circumstance which becomes known to the insured. However, we suppose that if the new circumstance were something which led to a loss within fifteen days, it could be said that it was not material as the insurer would have no effective opportunity to cancel. 
 duty of disclosure is by the insured, and that it only applies before the contract is concluded (which could no doubt include the new contract which is made upon renewal). But the maxim that mention of one of two things excludes the other must be applied with caution when considering the draftsmanship of Sir Mackenzie Chalmers. His method of codification was, at any rate at times, to state the effect of rules decided by the courts, and not to pronounce upon points which had not been decided. 
 whether the misrepresentation or non-disclosure would, if believed by a prudent underwriter, influence him in any relevant decision he had to make, e.g., the fixing of additional premium, or whether to pay, compromise, or resist a claim ... and also whether or not to invoke the 14 day cancellation clause.
 (1922) 13 Ll.L 75 and another case relied on by the insured as follows (at p.511):
 Consequently, I hold that the duty of utmost good faith applied with its full rigour in relation to the giving of information of the voyage under the warranty.
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
, this Court ought to extend (at least, so I understood him) the doctrine so as to meet a case of this kind, in order that the Underwriters should have the opportunity of giving the three months' notice when in fact the character or extent of the risk had altered. We asked him to formulate what the effect of introducing such a doctrine would be, and I think he must have felt himself in a difficulty in doing that, but ultimately I understood him to say that, if there was non-disclosure and an alteration of risk while the contract was a continuing contract, the Underwriter would have the right to exercise the option retrospectively when he became aware of the facts, as from the time when the disclosure ought to have been made, or alternatively, the contract should be treated as automatically concluded at the expiration of three months from that time. Well, I think that the statement of the consequences, which Mr Leslie Scott desires, indicate that this is not a case in which the doctrine can or ought to be applied. It may be that the Underwriters did not appreciate the difference in their position which they were making by the alteration in the form of the contract, and all I can say is that, if people enter into contracts of insurance for long periods, it would be a wise precaution to insert some provision requiring notice to be given them if the nature of the risk does alter or vary appreciably.
That doctrine is evidently based on an interpretation of the contract, and on the law of suretyship, rather than on a duty of disclosure imposed from outside by the law as in the case of a contract of insurance. As Mr Phillips said, it arises under an implied term, and not from a duty of the utmost good faith. It was considered in the American case of 
 We shall explain why we adopt the Restatement rule. That rule provides that each time the creditor accepts the continuing offer of a surety on a continuing guaranty by extending further credit to the principal debtor, the creditor owes a duty to the surety to disclose facts known by the creditor if the creditor has reason to believe that those facts materially increase the risk beyond that which the surety intended to assume and that those facts are unknown to the surety. (Rest., Security 124. subd.(1), com. c. pp. 327-328,330.) 
 However, the question remains whether the limit applies to all loss of the relevant insured in a particular policy year, or in some other way. 
 (a) the limit applies to all loss which flows from the conduct of a particular employee, even if he commits further dishonest and fraudulent acts in a later year which cause further loss, or
 (b) the limit applies to all loss caused by dishonest and fraudulent acts of a particular employee in the policy year in question, the loss being sustained or discovered in the policy period or the discovery period.
 Mr. Rokison also relied on the provisions as to a deductible in endorsement 4:
 policy and in part under a prior similar policy or bond superseded by this policy, the Deductible Amounts(s) applicable to such loss under this policy will be reduced by the amount of any deductible(s) actually applied to such loss under such other policy or bond.
 (1) Nothing is relevant unless it was known to, or reasonably capable of being known to, both parties at the time when the contract was made. In particular, an undisclosed intention held 
 (1992) 1 Ll R.7. But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties. In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it is rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy. That is not this case. Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to. The insurers cannot preempt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it. That was the reasoning of Potter J., and we agree with it. He also had something to say about the operations of Lloyd's Policy Signing Office, but with that we are not concerned in this case.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him.

 We suppose that point (1) can perhaps be described as a surrounding circumstance. At all events, we ruled that evidence of it was admissible when the dispute was last before this court, although that may have been a rather generous view. We have a good deal more doubt about the admissibility of points (2) and (3). But that only mattered when we were considering whether to save the parties from unnecessary expense and the judge from unnecessary labour by excluding evidence from the start. All that is now of importance is to say, as we do, that nothing in points (1), (2) and (3) is of any assistance in helping us to decide whether the insured were the companies identified or described in the wording, or else the Maxwell Group.

 Fraud is not something absolute, existing in vacuo; it is a fraud upon someone. A man who tries to cheat his underwriters fails if they find him out, but how does his wrong against them invest them with new rights against innocent strangers to it?

 Pergamon Group plc were the insured? If so, which? The expression and/or is very commonly used in describing who is insured under a policy - almost invariably, perhaps. But we doubt if it is used with lawyer-like precision. We would interpret it as saying, when the word insured is used in this document it may mean all of these companies, or else (depending on the context) it may mean any one of them. That is a perfectly sensible interpretation, although Mr Rokison says that it is too clever by half. For example, at the commencement of the policy it is said that
We do not see that this diversity of expressions is of any assistance to Mr Rokison in showing that the insured meant the Maxwell Group. The policy is not by any means written with the precision of an equity draftsman. Indeed we strongly suspect that it was not written by one person at all or at one time. It seems more likely that a number of hands have added or amended passages in it from time to time.
 At this point we feel that one should sit back and examine what we mean by the insured in an insurance contract. The expression in our view covers two aspects of the person described. First, he is the person with whom the insurer contracts, the party who is bound as such. Secondly he is the person who is interested in the property or other event covered by the insurance, and whose loss is to be made good if it occurs. For the first capacity the insured must, as it seems to us, be a natural or legal person. Mr Phillips referred us to the case of 
 (2) The court looks first at the written document alone, and determines what it means from the ordinary meaning of the language used, unless some customary meaning is pleaded and proved.
 (b) the policy wording numbered 81296514 and the documents referred to therein; and/or
 (d) the policy wording numbered 81296514A and the documents referred to therein.
 To the best of my knowledge I did not receive a copy of the Chubb excess layer wording for the subsequent policy year, namely, July 1991/June 1992. I am advised by Messrs Norton Rose, that they have reviewed all of the documents in the cabinet of original insurance policies and they have been unable to find any original or copy of the Chubb policy wording for the 1991/92 policy year, although the original for the previous year, together with the original letter dated the 13th February 1991 from Willis Corroon is contained in the cabinet.
The reason that the words (herein called the insured) appear to be out of place is that they are part of the pre-programmed wording into which details are subsequently inserted. (The days have unfortunately gone when one could tell at a glance how much of a document was printed for general use and how much typewritten for a specific purpose.)
 Pergamon Group plc were the insured? If so, which? The expression and/or is very commonly used in describing who is insured under a policy - almost invariably, perhaps. But we doubt if it is used with lawyer-like precision. We would interpret it as saying, when the word insured is used in this document it may mean all of these companies, or else (depending on the context) it may mean any one of them. That is a perfectly sensible interpretation, although Mr Rokison says that it is too clever by half. For example, at the commencement of the policy it is said that
 The origin of the order to ships' papers goes back to the time of Lord Mansfield. In those days the courts of common law did not give discovery of documents. If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.  In consequence partly of this inconvenience and partly of the fact that insurance has always been regarded as a transaction requiring the utmost good faith between the parties in which the assured is bound to communicate to the insurer every material fact within his knowledge not only at the inception of the risk, but at every subsequent stage while it continues, up to and including the time when he makes his claim, the common law courts invented the order for ship's papers, an order which is made as soon as the writ is issued in an action on a policy of marine insurance.
 It is, we were told, common ground that there is a duty to disclose before a contract of insurance is concluded, before such a contract is renewed, and when a claim is made. But Mr Milligan for the Claimants except the pension interests submits that the situation on making a claim is conceptually different; non-disclosure then can only lead to the avoidance of a compromise agreement, if there has been one, or a right to recover money paid on the ground of mistake; it does not result in avoidance of the contract of insurance, unless there is fraud, or unless the contract says that it can be avoided for non-disclosure in making a claim.
 whether the misrepresentation or non-disclosure would, if believed by a prudent underwriter, influence him in any relevant decision he had to make, e.g., the fixing of additional premium, or whether to pay, compromise, or resist a claim ... and also whether or not to invoke the 14 day cancellation clause.
 form part of the contracts? Apparently the parties agreed that there was no need for any amendments, at any rate for the time being. We do not feel that we should tolerate such a cavalier attitude. The Claimants should be required to amend their pleadings so as to delete assertions which they now themselves contradict.
 We have referred to that case merely as a possible illustration of the problem that we face in the present appeals. We are being asked to answer preliminary issues, which Waller J. ordered to be tried in two actions in the Commercial Court. That was no doubt a very sensible procedure. But it is sometimes helpful to us to have some live facts to bear in mind, rather than the dry bones of a preliminary issue.
That seems to us the high point of Mr Rokison's argument, although it also detracts from his submissions relating to Year 1 and Year 2. As usual there is the problem with alterations, did the parties mean to clarify what they had said previously or to change it?
 What the underwriter was seeking to do in these two cases was to fix upon the assured a duty to volunteer information ex post facto concerning new matter, which had come to light after the conclusion of the policy, and which affected the risk already accepted. The key to these cases is I think to be found in the dictum of Lord Buckmaster in the Niger case that there is no duty on the assured to disclose circumstances arising subsequently which might show that the premium had been accepted at too low a rate. This in my judgment does not touch the problem with which the Court is concerned in the present case.
 The problem arises in the special case of loss caused by the same employee to two companies. That is specifically dealt with in section 11 - 
That, as it seems to us, covers loss suffered partly during the period of one policy and partly in the period of another. It does not touch upon the present problem.
, this Court ought to extend (at least, so I understood him) the doctrine so as to meet a case of this kind, in order that the Underwriters should have the opportunity of giving the three months' notice when in fact the character or extent of the risk had altered. We asked him to formulate what the effect of introducing such a doctrine would be, and I think he must have felt himself in a difficulty in doing that, but ultimately I understood him to say that, if there was non-disclosure and an alteration of risk while the contract was a continuing contract, the Underwriter would have the right to exercise the option retrospectively when he became aware of the facts, as from the time when the disclosure ought to have been made, or alternatively, the contract should be treated as automatically concluded at the expiration of three months from that time. Well, I think that the statement of the consequences, which Mr Leslie Scott desires, indicate that this is not a case in which the doctrine can or ought to be applied. It may be that the Underwriters did not appreciate the difference in their position which they were making by the alteration in the form of the contract, and all I can say is that, if people enter into contracts of insurance for long periods, it would be a wise precaution to insert some provision requiring notice to be given them if the nature of the risk does alter or vary appreciably.
 Before the judge there was a good deal of evidence, both oral and in witness statements, by witnesses of fact and an expert. There was also some contest as to what was relevant and admissible on the topic of interpretation of the contracts, followed by an interlocutory appeal to this court comprising Staughton, Millett and Ward LJJ. In extempore judgments delivered on 15th June 1995 it is said that there was some slight divergence of view between them, and that Staughton LJ represented the middle ground. At all events the parties have been content to rely on that judgment. We would reiterate the four principles which it proposed relating to the material that is relevant to the interpretation of a written contract:
 (3) However, the court may also have regard to the surrounding circumstances, now commonly referred to as the matrix, the genesis or aim, the market in which the parties are operating. But this evidence must qualify under principle (1) if it is to be admitted.
The boundary of what may be considered surrounding circumstances, within principle (3), is unfortunately not easy to draw. All too often a great deal of evidence is produced under that head which is of little or no help to interpretation. The present case is no exception in that respect.
 Whether the Chubb Policies were contained in and/or evidenced by 
There is no direct evidence of any such form.  During the argument there were suggestions that WW might stand for Willis Wrightson, or for world wide. That must remain speculation. The slip also had the line CONDITIONS As per Primary Policy attached. That was the New Hampshire form of policy. 
There was evidence in support of points (i) and (ii) which was not in terms contradicted.  However, we were shown a letter dated 16th January 1991, to New Hampshire from Miss Godwin of the policy division at Willis Wrightson. It said in a postscript please could you send me one of your wdgs as I need to issue a Pol for 'Chub'. Miss Godwin did not give evidence.
 Secondly it was submitted that, once a policy has been issued, its terms are conclusive evidence of the contract between the parties unless and until it is altered by the process of rectification. That can happen by agreement of the parties or by order of a court but not otherwise. And there has been no application for rectification in this case.
 (1992) 1 Ll R.7. But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties. In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it is rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy. That is not this case. Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to. The insurers cannot preempt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it. That was the reasoning of Potter J., and we agree with it. He also had something to say about the operations of Lloyd's Policy Signing Office, but with that we are not concerned in this case.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
 We have not been told that there was any evidence of a custom in the insurance industry that policy details are accepted unless they are expressly questioned. Nor does there appear to have been any contention to that effect; it was merely said to be the usual practice as between Chubb and brokers. The judge did not regard the evidence of that as reliable. So we must consider the particular relationship and the particular circumstances of this case. We cannot attribute much, or indeed any, weight to the fact that Mr Ward wrote checked & okay on the letter, and put the policy in the place where original policies were kept; those were not circumstances which by inference conveyed acceptance to Chubb, since they did not know of them. Furthermore Mr Ward was a subordinate member of the Risk Management Department, under Mr Cox who was the head of it and whose task it was to review the primary policy wordings.
 Nevertheless we regard this as a borderline case. What determines the point, in our judgment, in favour of the Claimants is that the Chubb policy did not merely supplement what was in the slips; it contradicted them, since in each case the slip referred to a different form. In those circumstances we would require more than the evidence of silence that there is here to persuade us that acceptance by the insured should be inferred. Like the judge, we would answer issue (D) by saying that the Chubb forms of policy were not part of the terms of the contracts for the top layers in 1993 and 1994.
 We suppose that point (1) can perhaps be described as a surrounding circumstance. At all events, we ruled that evidence of it was admissible when the dispute was last before this court, although that may have been a rather generous view. We have a good deal more doubt about the admissibility of points (2) and (3). But that only mattered when we were considering whether to save the parties from unnecessary expense and the judge from unnecessary labour by excluding evidence from the start. All that is now of importance is to say, as we do, that nothing in points (1), (2) and (3) is of any assistance in helping us to decide whether the insured were the companies identified or described in the wording, or else the Maxwell Group.
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being

 We cannot accept that argument, if only for the reason that the implication would contradict the express terms of the contract. Each of the slips referred to a form; in our experience that is extremely common if not universal practice. In neither case was it the Chubb form. In those circumstances it cannot in our judgment be implied that the Chubb form was required by the contract that was concluded when the slips were initialled.

 It would appear to me that in some of the arguments addressed to your Lordships on behalf of the underwriters, the fact has not been kept in mind that the cover is by the terms of the slip I have read a continuous cover, not limited in duration, save by the fact that it may be terminated by three months' notice. I for myself beg to say that I can see no reason why the principle laid down in the cases I have cited as to the disclosure by the assured of material facts between the signing of the cover and the issue of the policy should not apply to the continuous cover created in this case.
 ... it seems to us equally reasonable to suppose that it never could have entered into the contemplation of the parties that, after the servant's dishonesty in the service had been discovered, the guarantee should continue to apply to his future conduct, when the master chose for his own purposes to continue the servant in his employ without the knowledge or assent of the surety. If the obligation of the surety is continuing, we think the obligation of the creditor is equally so, and that the representation and understanding on which the contract was originally founded continue to apply to it during its continuance and until its termination.
 We shall explain why we adopt the Restatement rule. That rule provides that each time the creditor accepts the continuing offer of a surety on a continuing guaranty by extending further credit to the principal debtor, the creditor owes a duty to the surety to disclose facts known by the creditor if the creditor has reason to believe that those facts materially increase the risk beyond that which the surety intended to assume and that those facts are unknown to the surety. (Rest., Security 124. subd.(1), com. c. pp. 327-328,330.) 
 We would answer this question by saying that there was no continuing duty of disclosure during the currency of any year of insurance by reason of the right to cancel. If and in so far as a contrary view was expressed in the 
 There remains a cross-appeal of the claimants, by leave of the judge, against his order for costs. This order was that the costs be reserved. He was apparently persuaded to take that course on the ground that it did not yet appear how relevant the preliminary issues would be to the ultimate result. We are afraid that we do not regard that as a good reason. The Insurers did not have to rely on the points which were raised as preliminary issues if they did not want to, instead of which the Insurers defended them (for the most part) here and below. As the price of failure, the costs below on the argument of preliminary issues should be paid by the Insurers in any event.
 (4) Evidence of negotiations is not admissible. This is subject to some exceptions, such as a case of rectification, or if it is said that agreement was reached in negotiations as to the meaning of a particular term, or that the contract was made by a continuous process of agreeing some terms and then turning to consider others.
The boundary of what may be considered surrounding circumstances, within principle (3), is unfortunately not easy to draw. All too often a great deal of evidence is produced under that head which is of little or no help to interpretation. The present case is no exception in that respect.
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being

 (3) The Risk Management Department knew that. Indeed they were told it, when they wished to increase the limit for one company which on its own would be rated more highly. They were told that it would be not much more expensive to increase the limit for all the companies - or all the group - because the rating based on predominant activity was lower.

 It is said that the situation is different in this case, because the Insurers - and for that matter the insured - had a right of cancellation. It is enough to refer only to one of the provisions in that connection.
 cases, where the duty was held to apply. The information is material because it is required to enable the underwriter to make a decision as to the rate of AP, as to facultative reinsurance, and (at all events in the present case) possibly even as to cancellation under the 14 day notice clause.
 There is no duty to disclose matters relevant to the making of the contract once the contract had been made; the time has then passed within which they must be disclosed. The later disclosure of later discovered facts would serve no useful purpose and, therefore, is not required. By contrast there can be situations which arise subsequently where the duty of utmost good faith makes it necessary that there should be further disclosure because the relevant facts are relevant to the later stages of the contract. The

We would echo that sentiment. Whilst there are no doubt cases where a defence of non-disclosure is fully justified, there are also in our experience some where it is not. We should hesitate to enlarge the scope for oppression by establishing a duty to disclose throughout the period of a contract of insurance, merely because it contains (as is by no means uncommon) a right of cancellation for the insurer.
 Despite emphatic protests by Mr Rokison whenever the topic was mentioned, once it had been decided under issue F that each company was separately insured the answer to this question must be that in general there was a separate limit for each company. We asked Mr Rokison whether there would be two limits if employee A caused loss to company X and employee B caused loss to company Y; his answer was that there would be two limits, each of Â£1 million at the primary layer.
 The problem arises in the special case of loss caused by the same employee to two companies. That is specifically dealt with in section 11 - 
 The Company's total liability (a) under Insuring Agreement 1 for all loss caused by any Employee or in which such Employee is concerned or implicated or (b) under Insuring Agreement V for all loss by forgery or alteration or in which such person is concerned or implicated ... is limited to the applicable amount of insurance specified in the Table of Limits of Liability or endorsement amendatory thereto.The liability of the Company for loss sustained by any or all of the Insured shall not exceed the amount for which the Company would be liable had all such loss been sustained by any one of the Insured.
 (a) the limit applies to all loss which flows from the conduct of a particular employee, even if he commits further dishonest and fraudulent acts in a later year which cause further loss, or
 (b) the limit applies to all loss caused by dishonest and fraudulent acts of a particular employee in the policy year in question, the loss being sustained or discovered in the policy period or the discovery period.
 With respect to loss caused by any person (whether one of the Employees or not) or in which such person is concerned or implicated or which is chargeable to any Employee as provided in Section 4 and which occurs partly during the Policy Period and partly during the period of other bonds or policies issued by the Company to the Insured or to any predecessor in interest of the insured and terminated or cancelled or allowed to expire and in which the period for discovery has not expired at the time any such loss thereunder is discovered, the total liability of the Company under this Policy and under such other bonds or policies shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount carried under the applicable Insuring Agreement of this Policy on such loss or the amount available to the Insured under such other bonds or policies, as limited by the terms and conditions thereof, for any such loss, if the latter amount be the larger.
 All loss caused by acts committed by any person or in which such person is concerned or implicated and/or arising from any one occurrence (as set forth in Section II of the policy) will be considered a single loss for the purpose of this endorsement. If a loss is covered in part under this 
 The answer is in our judgment plain. Section II says that the limit is to apply to all loss caused by any employee or in which such employee is concerned or implicated. But that is subject to section 12 in respect of loss straddling two policy periods.
 Potter J had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt that there were likely to be situations whereby an officer of Company A, as well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the affairs of Company C and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or obligations of good faith in respect of all three. We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.
 (1) Nothing is relevant unless it was known to, or reasonably capable of being known to, both parties at the time when the contract was made. In particular, an undisclosed intention held 
 That, as it seems to us, is this case. The companies that formed the Maxwell group had separate interests to insure, and not a joint interest in the same property. That must have been known to the Insurers, in the light of the companies' disparate businesses and seeing that one of them was Mirror Group Newspapers. It is not clear why they adopted a different definition of the insured for Year 3 and Year 4. But that definition was still capable of referring to the companies rather than the group as parties to the insurance contract (as they must have been), and also as the owners of separate interests which were to be covered by insurance separately. That in our judgment was the intention of the parties, and the effect of the policies. It is true that there is in the policies a clause headed Joint Insured. But the content of the clause does not go as far as to say that all those insured have joint interests or are joint contractors. Rather it deals with some specific points which arise under another issue.

There is no direct evidence of any such form.  During the argument there were suggestions that WW might stand for Willis Wrightson, or for world wide. That must remain speculation. The slip also had the line CONDITIONS As per Primary Policy attached. That was the New Hampshire form of policy. 
 We cannot accept that argument, if only for the reason that the implication would contradict the express terms of the contract. Each of the slips referred to a form; in our experience that is extremely common if not universal practice. In neither case was it the Chubb form. In those circumstances it cannot in our judgment be implied that the Chubb form was required by the contract that was concluded when the slips were initialled.
 The field of insurance may well be one where it is normal practice to make a preliminary contract, and then for one party (the insurers) to send detailed terms to the other, not expecting a reply unless the other regards them as unsatisfactory. This may be what happens in ordinary life with motor insurance or householder's comprehensive insurance. Often the necessary acceptance can be inferred when the insured, having received the proposed policy, pays the premium. We enquired whether that was a possible answer in the present case, but it seems that no such argument was put forward before the judge and the facts found in relation to the premium are insufficient.
That seems to us the high point of Mr Rokison's argument, although it also detracts from his submissions relating to Year 1 and Year 2. As usual there is the problem with alterations, did the parties mean to clarify what they had said previously or to change it?
It is said that disclosure would be of value to an insurer when he has an unfettered right to cancel; hence there is a continuing duty of disclosure. The argument cannot, as we see it, be anything less than that the duty applies on every day of the policy period, to every material circumstance which becomes known to the insured. However, we suppose that if the new circumstance were something which led to a loss within fifteen days, it could be said that it was not material as the insurer would have no effective opportunity to cancel. 
 Mr. Rokison's submission is that section 18(1) is merely an example of the general duty that is placed on both parties, at all times, by section 17. We can see force in that argument. But it is questionable whether in practice the law has been treated in that way. 
 The argument of Mr Gilman for the insurers in the 
Hirst J. accepted that argument. He distinguished 
The judge rejected those arguments. He observed that the ability to cancel was thought to be quite irrelevant by Lord Buckmaster in the 
 It would appear to me that in some of the arguments addressed to your Lordships on behalf of the underwriters, the fact has not been kept in mind that the cover is by the terms of the slip I have read a continuous cover, not limited in duration, save by the fact that it may be terminated by three months' notice. I for myself beg to say that I can see no reason why the principle laid down in the cases I have cited as to the disclosure by the assured of material facts between the signing of the cover and the issue of the policy should not apply to the continuous cover created in this case.
Lord Sumner, in connection with an argument on this or another point of non-disclosure, said (at p.82):
There is perhaps a slightly stronger argument that all loss in that clause includes loss from fraudulent or dishonest acts in a subsequent year. But it is only marginal, and not in our judgment sufficient to carry the day in relation to limits.
 The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed. So should the Insurers' application for leave to appeal on certain aspects of the judge's rulings as to the admissibility of evidence. No argument was addressed to us in support of that application.
 There remains a cross-appeal of the claimants, by leave of the judge, against his order for costs. This order was that the costs be reserved. He was apparently persuaded to take that course on the ground that it did not yet appear how relevant the preliminary issues would be to the ultimate result. We are afraid that we do not regard that as a good reason. The Insurers did not have to rely on the points which were raised as preliminary issues if they did not want to, instead of which the Insurers defended them (for the most part) here and below. As the price of failure, the costs below on the argument of preliminary issues should be paid by the Insurers in any event.
 The question whether there is a continuing duty of disclosure in any other circumstances is of considerable importance. We are surprised that in recent times it has only been considered in one decision at first instance: 
 (1985) 1 Ll R 437. However, the surprise is tempered when one realises that, in the ordinary way, disclosure would be of little or no benefit to the insurer during the currency of a policy. Unless it happen before the contract is made, or before renewal, or (perhaps) before a claim is paid, disclosure could only fill the insurer with foreboding that he had made a bad bargain as a loss was likely to occur; he would have no right to cancel the contract of insurance on that account, although we suppose that he might be able to obtain reinsurance.
 this court had to consider what system of law should determine who had the better title to some shares in Berlitz International Inc., a New York Corporation. The facts in that case, either proved or assumed, were as follows: Macmillan (the 11th defendants in one of the present actions) were a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxwell Communications Corporation plc, a company owned partly by the public and partly by Mr Robert Maxwell and his family; they had a majority holding in the shares of Berlitz; those shares were transferred out of Macmillan's name to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, who were owned and controlled by Mr Maxwell and his family; and then the shares were pledged to secure the debts of companies in the private ownership of Mr Maxwell and his family. Thus Macmillan suffered a loss and those latter companies received a gain, unless and until Macmillan succeed in recovering the shares or (since they have now been sold by agreement) their value.
 We have referred to that case merely as a possible illustration of the problem that we face in the present appeals. We are being asked to answer preliminary issues, which Waller J. ordered to be tried in two actions in the Commercial Court. That was no doubt a very sensible procedure. But it is sometimes helpful to us to have some live facts to bear in mind, rather than the dry bones of a preliminary issue.
New Hampshire were the leading underwriters on all contracts, except for the top Â£10 million layers in 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, which were subscribed only by Chubb Insurance Company of Europe SA. Other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyds, who are the second to twenty-sixth plaintiffs in action 1993 folio 440, subscribed the contracts except for those written by New Hampshire or Chubb alone. It is not possible to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendants, as there are two actions and for the most part the same parties feature on opposite sides. So we will refer to all the insurers collectively as the Insurers, and as the Other Insurers when we are excluding Chubb. The beneficiaries of the insurance contracts were on one view companies in the Maxwell group, together with some pension fund trustees, and on another the Maxwell group itself. It is the companies, or rather some of them, and the trustees who feature as parties in these actions. They have been called the Claimants. As has already been mentioned, in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.

We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.
 The origin of the order to ships' papers goes back to the time of Lord Mansfield. In those days the courts of common law did not give discovery of documents. If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.  In consequence partly of this inconvenience and partly of the fact that insurance has always been regarded as a transaction requiring the utmost good faith between the parties in which the assured is bound to communicate to the insurer every material fact within his knowledge not only at the inception of the risk, but at every subsequent stage while it continues, up to and including the time when he makes his claim, the common law courts invented the order for ship's papers, an order which is made as soon as the writ is issued in an action on a policy of marine insurance.

 That decision was approved by Lord Steyn in 
 The question whether there is a continuing duty of disclosure in any other circumstances is of considerable importance. We are surprised that in recent times it has only been considered in one decision at first instance: 
 whether the misrepresentation or non-disclosure would, if believed by a prudent underwriter, influence him in any relevant decision he had to make, e.g., the fixing of additional premium, or whether to pay, compromise, or resist a claim ... and also whether or not to invoke the 14 day cancellation clause.
 cases, where the duty was held to apply. The information is material because it is required to enable the underwriter to make a decision as to the rate of AP, as to facultative reinsurance, and (at all events in the present case) possibly even as to cancellation under the 14 day notice clause.
 The decision of Hirst J. was referred to with approval by Hobhouse J. in

 (1990) 1 QB 818 summarised the reasoning of Hobhouse J. at first instance and the decision of Hirst J. in the 
 The plaintiff seeks to strike out pars 15 to 16 inclusive of the first defendant's amended defence. In essence, by those paragraphs, the first defendant, an insurer, seeks to avoid liability under a policy of insurance on the basis that, during the currency of the policy the insured failed to comply with its obligation to act in good faith by failing to disclose certain material facts. It is claimed by the insurer that the disclosure of the facts was required by it in order to enable it to exercise two alternatives which were available to it. First, under condition D(v), the insurer had the opportunity of giving thirty days notice to terminate the policy. Secondly, it had the opportunity throughout of obtaining facultative reinsurance. It is said that the disclosures, if made, would have borne materially on a decision whether or not either or both of these opportunities should be availed of.
 (b) to obtain financial benefit for the Employee, or for any other person or organisation intended by the Employee to receive such benefit, other than salaries, commissions, fees, bonuses, promotions, awards, profit sharing, pensions or other employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment.
We do not see that this diversity of expressions is of any assistance to Mr Rokison in showing that the insured meant the Maxwell Group. The policy is not by any means written with the precision of an equity draftsman. Indeed we strongly suspect that it was not written by one person at all or at one time. It seems more likely that a number of hands have added or amended passages in it from time to time.
 At this point we feel that one should sit back and examine what we mean by the insured in an insurance contract. The expression in our view covers two aspects of the person described. First, he is the person with whom the insurer contracts, the party who is bound as such. Secondly he is the person who is interested in the property or other event covered by the insurance, and whose loss is to be made good if it occurs. For the first capacity the insured must, as it seems to us, be a natural or legal person. Mr Phillips referred us to the case of 
 Liability of unincorporated associations. An unincorporated association is not a legal person and therefore cannot sue or be sued unless such a course is authorised by express or implied statutory provisions as in the case of a trade union and a trustee savings bank. Nor can a contract be made so as to bind all persons who from time to time become members of such an association. But a contract purportedly made by or with an incorporated association is not necessarily a nullity. If the person or persons who actually made the contract had no authority to contract on behalf of the members they may be held to have contracted personally. On the other hand, if they had the authority, express or implied, of all or some of the members of the association to contract on their behalf, the contract can be enforced by or against those members as co-principals to the contract by the ordinary rules of agency.
 It may well be that, when two persons are jointly insured and their interests are inseparably connected so that a loss or gain necessarily affects them both, the misconduct of one is sufficient to contaminate the whole insurance: Phillips on Marine Insurance, vol.i., at 235. But in this case there is no difficulty in separating the interest of the mortgagee from that of the owner.
 A policy issued to many persons will amount to several insurance if the persons insured have different interests in the subject matter of the insurance.
 That there can be a joint insurance by persons having a joint interest is, of course, manifest. If A and B are joint owners of property - and I use that phrase in the strict sense - an undertaking to indemnify them jointly is a true contract of indemnity in respect of a joint loss which they have jointly suffered. Again, there can be no objection to combining in one insurance a number of persons having different interests in the subject-matter of the insurance, but I find myself unable to see how an insurance of that character can be called a joint insurance. In such a case the interest of each of the insured is different. The amount of his loss, if the subject-matter of the insurance is destroyed or damaged, depends on the nature of his interest, and the covenant of indemnity which the policy gives must, in such a case, necessarily operate as a covenant to indemnify in respect of each individual different loss which the various persons named may suffer. In such a case there is no joint element at all.
. That, it is true, was not a case of non-disclosure but of wilful misconduct by one of two persons insured. But in our opinion the principle that the innocent party can still recover if it is a separate insurance must equally apply.
any other person or organisation.
 The Company's total liability (a) under Insuring Agreement 1 for all loss caused by any Employee or in which such Employee is concerned or implicated or (b) under Insuring Agreement V for all loss by forgery or alteration or in which such person is concerned or implicated ... is limited to the applicable amount of insurance specified in the Table of Limits of Liability or endorsement amendatory thereto.The liability of the Company for loss sustained by any or all of the Insured shall not exceed the amount for which the Company would be liable had all such loss been sustained by any one of the Insured.

 It is, we were told, common ground that there is a duty to disclose before a contract of insurance is concluded, before such a contract is renewed, and when a claim is made. But Mr Milligan for the Claimants except the pension interests submits that the situation on making a claim is conceptually different; non-disclosure then can only lead to the avoidance of a compromise agreement, if there has been one, or a right to recover money paid on the ground of mistake; it does not result in avoidance of the contract of insurance, unless there is fraud, or unless the contract says that it can be avoided for non-disclosure in making a claim.

That would have needed consideration if those policies had been incorporated in the contracts; but they were not. The slips for Chubb in Year 3 and Year 4 had the same description of the insured, with very slight and immaterial variations, as the New Hampshire policies for those years.
Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust plc
 this court had to consider what system of law should determine who had the better title to some shares in Berlitz International Inc., a New York Corporation. The facts in that case, either proved or assumed, were as follows: Macmillan (the 11th defendants in one of the present actions) were a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxwell Communications Corporation plc, a company owned partly by the public and partly by Mr Robert Maxwell and his family; they had a majority holding in the shares of Berlitz; those shares were transferred out of Macmillan's name to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, who were owned and controlled by Mr Maxwell and his family; and then the shares were pledged to secure the debts of companies in the private ownership of Mr Maxwell and his family. Thus Macmillan suffered a loss and those latter companies received a gain, unless and until Macmillan succeed in recovering the shares or (since they have now been sold by agreement) their value.
 Thirdly there was the Chubb policy no. 812965414. This was on a Chubb form headed Excess Fidelity Policy. It is, presumably, the Chubb Follow Form, and is significantly different from the New Hampshire form. It was signed on behalf of Chubb on 21st January 1991. It evidently reached the brokers, since they sent it on to Mr Ward of Maxwell Communication Corporation plc on 13th February 1991. Mr Ward was employed in the Risk Management Department, which assumed the task of arranging insurance for the Maxwell Group - or for all the companies in it. On the letter from the brokers which enclosed the Chubb policy he wrote
 Pergamon Holdings Limited &/or Pergamon Group plc &/or Pergamon Media Trust plc &/or Hollis plc &/Or Maxwell Communications Corporation plc &/Or Mirror Holdings Ltd &/Or Subsidiary Companies &/Or Associated Companies &/Or Companies for whom they have (herein called the Insured) instructions to insure.
 Pergamon Group plc were the insured? If so, which? The expression and/or is very commonly used in describing who is insured under a policy - almost invariably, perhaps. But we doubt if it is used with lawyer-like precision. We would interpret it as saying, when the word insured is used in this document it may mean all of these companies, or else (depending on the context) it may mean any one of them. That is a perfectly sensible interpretation, although Mr Rokison says that it is too clever by half. For example, at the commencement of the policy it is said that
 Pergamon Group plc etc. On the other hand there is cover against loss through forgery of any cheque or bill of exchange

 (3) The Risk Management Department knew that. Indeed they were told it, when they wished to increase the limit for one company which on its own would be rated more highly. They were told that it would be not much more expensive to increase the limit for all the companies - or all the group - because the rating based on predominant activity was lower.
 What then of the second role of the Insured, as the owner of property or some other interest who will suffer loss if it is affected by an insured peril? On many occasions it may not make much difference whether the insured is the group, or the parent company, or the subsidiaries; all will ultimately have the same interest in the safety of the group's property. But on other occasions the interests will not be the same and ought to be insured separately. Some of the companies in the Maxwell group were publicly owned, although Mr. Maxwell had a controlling interest. It would, as it seems to us, have been a breach of duty by the directors of those companies if they had knowingly allowed the companies' property to be insured on terms which did not afford cover in the event of misconduct by companies in Mr. Maxwell's private ownership. The genesis or aim of the insurance contract was, we think, accurately stated by the judge:
 (1) Do the policy limits apply separately to each company within the Group, i.e. as a limit per insured company, or is there a single limit applicable to all companies within the group?
Question L (1) - Separate limits for each company?
 Despite emphatic protests by Mr Rokison whenever the topic was mentioned, once it had been decided under issue F that each company was separately insured the answer to this question must be that in general there was a separate limit for each company. We asked Mr Rokison whether there would be two limits if employee A caused loss to company X and employee B caused loss to company Y; his answer was that there would be two limits, each of Â£1 million at the primary layer.
 Liability of unincorporated associations. An unincorporated association is not a legal person and therefore cannot sue or be sued unless such a course is authorised by express or implied statutory provisions as in the case of a trade union and a trustee savings bank. Nor can a contract be made so as to bind all persons who from time to time become members of such an association. But a contract purportedly made by or with an incorporated association is not necessarily a nullity. If the person or persons who actually made the contract had no authority to contract on behalf of the members they may be held to have contracted personally. On the other hand, if they had the authority, express or implied, of all or some of the members of the association to contract on their behalf, the contract can be enforced by or against those members as co-principals to the contract by the ordinary rules of agency.

any other person or organisation.
, on the trustworthiness of the servant, so far as that was known to both parties, as soon as his dishonesty is discovered and becomes known to the master, the whole foundation for the continuance of the contract as regards the surety fails.
 Potter J had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt that there were likely to be situations whereby an officer of Company A, as well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the affairs of Company C and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or obligations of good faith in respect of all three. We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.
 What then of the second role of the Insured, as the owner of property or some other interest who will suffer loss if it is affected by an insured peril? On many occasions it may not make much difference whether the insured is the group, or the parent company, or the subsidiaries; all will ultimately have the same interest in the safety of the group's property. But on other occasions the interests will not be the same and ought to be insured separately. Some of the companies in the Maxwell group were publicly owned, although Mr. Maxwell had a controlling interest. It would, as it seems to us, have been a breach of duty by the directors of those companies if they had knowingly allowed the companies' property to be insured on terms which did not afford cover in the event of misconduct by companies in Mr. Maxwell's private ownership. The genesis or aim of the insurance contract was, we think, accurately stated by the judge:
 Pergamon Group plc were the insured? If so, which? The expression and/or is very commonly used in describing who is insured under a policy - almost invariably, perhaps. But we doubt if it is used with lawyer-like precision. We would interpret it as saying, when the word insured is used in this document it may mean all of these companies, or else (depending on the context) it may mean any one of them. That is a perfectly sensible interpretation, although Mr Rokison says that it is too clever by half. For example, at the commencement of the policy it is said that
We do not see that this diversity of expressions is of any assistance to Mr Rokison in showing that the insured meant the Maxwell Group. The policy is not by any means written with the precision of an equity draftsman. Indeed we strongly suspect that it was not written by one person at all or at one time. It seems more likely that a number of hands have added or amended passages in it from time to time.
 At this point we feel that one should sit back and examine what we mean by the insured in an insurance contract. The expression in our view covers two aspects of the person described. First, he is the person with whom the insurer contracts, the party who is bound as such. Secondly he is the person who is interested in the property or other event covered by the insurance, and whose loss is to be made good if it occurs. For the first capacity the insured must, as it seems to us, be a natural or legal person. Mr Phillips referred us to the case of 
 (4) Evidence of negotiations is not admissible. This is subject to some exceptions, such as a case of rectification, or if it is said that agreement was reached in negotiations as to the meaning of a particular term, or that the contract was made by a continuous process of agreeing some terms and then turning to consider others.
The boundary of what may be considered surrounding circumstances, within principle (3), is unfortunately not easy to draw. All too often a great deal of evidence is produced under that head which is of little or no help to interpretation. The present case is no exception in that respect.
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
There is no direct evidence of any such form.  During the argument there were suggestions that WW might stand for Willis Wrightson, or for world wide. That must remain speculation. The slip also had the line CONDITIONS As per Primary Policy attached. That was the New Hampshire form of policy. 
 We cannot accept that argument, if only for the reason that the implication would contradict the express terms of the contract. Each of the slips referred to a form; in our experience that is extremely common if not universal practice. In neither case was it the Chubb form. In those circumstances it cannot in our judgment be implied that the Chubb form was required by the contract that was concluded when the slips were initialled.
 The field of insurance may well be one where it is normal practice to make a preliminary contract, and then for one party (the insurers) to send detailed terms to the other, not expecting a reply unless the other regards them as unsatisfactory. This may be what happens in ordinary life with motor insurance or householder's comprehensive insurance. Often the necessary acceptance can be inferred when the insured, having received the proposed policy, pays the premium. We enquired whether that was a possible answer in the present case, but it seems that no such argument was put forward before the judge and the facts found in relation to the premium are insufficient.
That seems to us the high point of Mr Rokison's argument, although it also detracts from his submissions relating to Year 1 and Year 2. As usual there is the problem with alterations, did the parties mean to clarify what they had said previously or to change it?
It is said that disclosure would be of value to an insurer when he has an unfettered right to cancel; hence there is a continuing duty of disclosure. The argument cannot, as we see it, be anything less than that the duty applies on every day of the policy period, to every material circumstance which becomes known to the insured. However, we suppose that if the new circumstance were something which led to a loss within fifteen days, it could be said that it was not material as the insurer would have no effective opportunity to cancel. 
 Mr. Rokison's submission is that section 18(1) is merely an example of the general duty that is placed on both parties, at all times, by section 17. We can see force in that argument. But it is questionable whether in practice the law has been treated in that way. 
 The argument of Mr Gilman for the insurers in the 
Hirst J. accepted that argument. He distinguished 
The judge rejected those arguments. He observed that the ability to cancel was thought to be quite irrelevant by Lord Buckmaster in the 
 It would appear to me that in some of the arguments addressed to your Lordships on behalf of the underwriters, the fact has not been kept in mind that the cover is by the terms of the slip I have read a continuous cover, not limited in duration, save by the fact that it may be terminated by three months' notice. I for myself beg to say that I can see no reason why the principle laid down in the cases I have cited as to the disclosure by the assured of material facts between the signing of the cover and the issue of the policy should not apply to the continuous cover created in this case.
Lord Sumner, in connection with an argument on this or another point of non-disclosure, said (at p.82):
There is perhaps a slightly stronger argument that all loss in that clause includes loss from fraudulent or dishonest acts in a subsequent year. But it is only marginal, and not in our judgment sufficient to carry the day in relation to limits.
 The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed. So should the Insurers' application for leave to appeal on certain aspects of the judge's rulings as to the admissibility of evidence. No argument was addressed to us in support of that application.
 There remains a cross-appeal of the claimants, by leave of the judge, against his order for costs. This order was that the costs be reserved. He was apparently persuaded to take that course on the ground that it did not yet appear how relevant the preliminary issues would be to the ultimate result. We are afraid that we do not regard that as a good reason. The Insurers did not have to rely on the points which were raised as preliminary issues if they did not want to, instead of which the Insurers defended them (for the most part) here and below. As the price of failure, the costs below on the argument of preliminary issues should be paid by the Insurers in any event.
 We suppose that point (1) can perhaps be described as a surrounding circumstance. At all events, we ruled that evidence of it was admissible when the dispute was last before this court, although that may have been a rather generous view. We have a good deal more doubt about the admissibility of points (2) and (3). But that only mattered when we were considering whether to save the parties from unnecessary expense and the judge from unnecessary labour by excluding evidence from the start. All that is now of importance is to say, as we do, that nothing in points (1), (2) and (3) is of any assistance in helping us to decide whether the insured were the companies identified or described in the wording, or else the Maxwell Group.

 duty of disclosure is by the insured, and that it only applies before the contract is concluded (which could no doubt include the new contract which is made upon renewal). But the maxim that mention of one of two things excludes the other must be applied with caution when considering the draftsmanship of Sir Mackenzie Chalmers. His method of codification was, at any rate at times, to state the effect of rules decided by the courts, and not to pronounce upon points which had not been decided. 
 We shall explain why we adopt the Restatement rule. That rule provides that each time the creditor accepts the continuing offer of a surety on a continuing guaranty by extending further credit to the principal debtor, the creditor owes a duty to the surety to disclose facts known by the creditor if the creditor has reason to believe that those facts materially increase the risk beyond that which the surety intended to assume and that those facts are unknown to the surety. (Rest., Security 124. subd.(1), com. c. pp. 327-328,330.)

 (1992) 1 Ll R.7. But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties. In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it is rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy. That is not this case. Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to. The insurers cannot preempt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it. That was the reasoning of Potter J., and we agree with it. He also had something to say about the operations of Lloyd's Policy Signing Office, but with that we are not concerned in this case.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.

 this court had to consider what system of law should determine who had the better title to some shares in Berlitz International Inc., a New York Corporation. The facts in that case, either proved or assumed, were as follows: Macmillan (the 11th defendants in one of the present actions) were a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxwell Communications Corporation plc, a company owned partly by the public and partly by Mr Robert Maxwell and his family; they had a majority holding in the shares of Berlitz; those shares were transferred out of Macmillan's name to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, who were owned and controlled by Mr Maxwell and his family; and then the shares were pledged to secure the debts of companies in the private ownership of Mr Maxwell and his family. Thus Macmillan suffered a loss and those latter companies received a gain, unless and until Macmillan succeed in recovering the shares or (since they have now been sold by agreement) their value.
New Hampshire were the leading underwriters on all contracts, except for the top Â£10 million layers in 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, which were subscribed only by Chubb Insurance Company of Europe SA. Other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyds, who are the second to twenty-sixth plaintiffs in action 1993 folio 440, subscribed the contracts except for those written by New Hampshire or Chubb alone. It is not possible to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendants, as there are two actions and for the most part the same parties feature on opposite sides. So we will refer to all the insurers collectively as the Insurers, and as the Other Insurers when we are excluding Chubb. The beneficiaries of the insurance contracts were on one view companies in the Maxwell group, together with some pension fund trustees, and on another the Maxwell group itself. It is the companies, or rather some of them, and the trustees who feature as parties in these actions. They have been called the Claimants. As has already been mentioned, in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone.
 The insurance cover at the first layer was on the form of New Hampshire, headed Comprehensive Dishonesty, Disappearance and Destruction Policy Form A. All subsequent layers were on the same form, save that there is a dispute when it comes to the Chubb contracts. In broad terms it is an insurance against crime. The first part of the cover, and that with which the present dispute is concerned, is defined as follows:
 Before the judge there was a good deal of evidence, both oral and in witness statements, by witnesses of fact and an expert. There was also some contest as to what was relevant and admissible on the topic of interpretation of the contracts, followed by an interlocutory appeal to this court comprising Staughton, Millett and Ward LJJ. In extempore judgments delivered on 15th June 1995 it is said that there was some slight divergence of view between them, and that Staughton LJ represented the middle ground. At all events the parties have been content to rely on that judgment. We would reiterate the four principles which it proposed relating to the material that is relevant to the interpretation of a written contract:
 (1) Nothing is relevant unless it was known to, or reasonably capable of being known to, both parties at the time when the contract was made. In particular, an undisclosed intention held 
 by one of the parties is not admissible for the purpose of interpretation.
 (3) However, the court may also have regard to the surrounding circumstances, now commonly referred to as the matrix, the genesis or aim, the market in which the parties are operating. But this evidence must qualify under principle (1) if it is to be admitted.
 (4) Evidence of negotiations is not admissible. This is subject to some exceptions, such as a case of rectification, or if it is said that agreement was reached in negotiations as to the meaning of a particular term, or that the contract was made by a continuous process of agreeing some terms and then turning to consider others.
 This issue relates to what have been called Year 3 and Year 4 of the insurance. The question is whether Chubb's form of policy became, in each case, part of the contract for the top Â£10 million layer which Chubb insured.
 Thirdly there was the Chubb policy no. 812965414. This was on a Chubb form headed Excess Fidelity Policy. It is, presumably, the Chubb Follow Form, and is significantly different from the New Hampshire form. It was signed on behalf of Chubb on 21st January 1991. It evidently reached the brokers, since they sent it on to Mr Ward of Maxwell Communication Corporation plc on 13th February 1991. Mr Ward was employed in the Risk Management Department, which assumed the task of arranging insurance for the Maxwell Group - or for all the companies in it. On the letter from the brokers which enclosed the Chubb policy he wrote
 Thereafter policy no 81296514A was prepared on the Chubb form and sent to the brokers on 8th August 1991. In relation to that year Mr Ward of the Risk Management Department said this in his statement:
 It is conceivable, bearing in mind the time period between renewal and the collapse of the Maxwell Group, that the 1991/92 wording would not have been received by the department prior to my leaving at the end of 1992. Possibly it was stuck in the system at Willis Corroon.
 In neither year was there any complaint or protest about the terms of the Chubb policy, either by the brokers or the Risk Management Department of the Maxwell Group, so far as we are aware.
 The pleading of Chubb as to how the two policies came to form part of the contracts is distinctly vague, and there was no request for Further and Better Particulars. But Mr Phillips on their behalf put his case in three ways. First he submitted that, when each of the slips was initialled by Chubb, it was implied in the terms thereby agreed that the Chubb Follow Form was part of the contract.
  (iv) Subsequent conduct of the parties was consistent only with that.
 Secondly it was submitted that, once a policy has been issued, its terms are conclusive evidence of the contract between the parties unless and until it is altered by the process of rectification. That can happen by agreement of the parties or by order of a court but not otherwise. And there has been no application for rectification in this case.
 (1992) 1 Ll R.7. But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties. In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it is rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy. That is not this case. Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to. The insurers cannot preempt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it. That was the reasoning of Potter J., and we agree with it. He also had something to say about the operations of Lloyd's Policy Signing Office, but with that we are not concerned in this case.
 The third submission of Mr Phillips is the most promising. It is that there was a variation, agreed to on the part of the insured by silence. Although in the case of Year 3 it may only have occurred after the contract had been in force for five months, presumably it was retrospective.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
 One cannot generalise on the point. It all depends on the particular contractual relationship and the particular circumstances of the case.
. (1877) 2 App Cas 666). But we feel that we should proceed with some caution before giving too large a licence to one party to a proposed contract to thrust terms on the other without his explicit approval.
 The field of insurance may well be one where it is normal practice to make a preliminary contract, and then for one party (the insurers) to send detailed terms to the other, not expecting a reply unless the other regards them as unsatisfactory. This may be what happens in ordinary life with motor insurance or householder's comprehensive insurance. Often the necessary acceptance can be inferred when the insured, having received the proposed policy, pays the premium. We enquired whether that was a possible answer in the present case, but it seems that no such argument was put forward before the judge and the facts found in relation to the premium are insufficient.
 We have not been told that there was any evidence of a custom in the insurance industry that policy details are accepted unless they are expressly questioned. Nor does there appear to have been any contention to that effect; it was merely said to be the usual practice as between Chubb and brokers. The judge did not regard the evidence of that as reliable. So we must consider the particular relationship and the particular circumstances of this case. We cannot attribute much, or indeed any, weight to the fact that Mr Ward wrote checked & okay on the letter, and put the policy in the place where original policies were kept; those were not circumstances which by inference conveyed acceptance to Chubb, since they did not know of them. Furthermore Mr Ward was a subordinate member of the Risk Management Department, under Mr Cox who was the head of it and whose task it was to review the primary policy wordings.
 Nevertheless we regard this as a borderline case. What determines the point, in our judgment, in favour of the Claimants is that the Chubb policy did not merely supplement what was in the slips; it contradicted them, since in each case the slip referred to a different form. In those circumstances we would require more than the evidence of silence that there is here to persuade us that acceptance by the insured should be inferred. Like the judge, we would answer issue (D) by saying that the Chubb forms of policy were not part of the terms of the contracts for the top layers in 1993 and 1994.
Mr Phillips in the course of his reply pointed out that it was and remains the pleaded case of the Claimants that the Chubb policy did form part of the contracts. How then were they allowed to procure a preliminary issue from Waller J., and to argue before Potter J. that the Chubb policy did 
 form part of the contracts? Apparently the parties agreed that there was no need for any amendments, at any rate for the time being. We do not feel that we should tolerate such a cavalier attitude. The Claimants should be required to amend their pleadings so as to delete assertions which they now themselves contradict.
The reason that the words (herein called the insured) appear to be out of place is that they are part of the pre-programmed wording into which details are subsequently inserted. (The days have unfortunately gone when one could tell at a glance how much of a document was printed for general use and how much typewritten for a specific purpose.)
 (3) The Risk Management Department knew that. Indeed they were told it, when they wished to increase the limit for one company which on its own would be rated more highly. They were told that it would be not much more expensive to increase the limit for all the companies - or all the group - because the rating based on predominant activity was lower.
 We suppose that point (1) can perhaps be described as a surrounding circumstance. At all events, we ruled that evidence of it was admissible when the dispute was last before this court, although that may have been a rather generous view. We have a good deal more doubt about the admissibility of points (2) and (3). But that only mattered when we were considering whether to save the parties from unnecessary expense and the judge from unnecessary labour by excluding evidence from the start. All that is now of importance is to say, as we do, that nothing in points (1), (2) and (3) is of any assistance in helping us to decide whether the insured were the companies identified or described in the wording, or else the Maxwell Group.
That seems to us the high point of Mr Rokison's argument, although it also detracts from his submissions relating to Year 1 and Year 2. As usual there is the problem with alterations, did the parties mean to clarify what they had said previously or to change it?
 At this point we feel that one should sit back and examine what we mean by the insured in an insurance contract. The expression in our view covers two aspects of the person described. First, he is the person with whom the insurer contracts, the party who is bound as such. Secondly he is the person who is interested in the property or other event covered by the insurance, and whose loss is to be made good if it occurs. For the first capacity the insured must, as it seems to us, be a natural or legal person. Mr Phillips referred us to the case of 
 (1947) KB 685 as authority for the proposition that a trade union can be a party to a contract of insurance. However that may be, we do not see that something called a group can be a party to a contract, otherwise than as a contract with all of its members. See 
 That, as it seems to us, is this case. The companies that formed the Maxwell group had separate interests to insure, and not a joint interest in the same property. That must have been known to the Insurers, in the light of the companies' disparate businesses and seeing that one of them was Mirror Group Newspapers. It is not clear why they adopted a different definition of the insured for Year 3 and Year 4. But that definition was still capable of referring to the companies rather than the group as parties to the insurance contract (as they must have been), and also as the owners of separate interests which were to be covered by insurance separately. That in our judgment was the intention of the parties, and the effect of the policies. It is true that there is in the policies a clause headed Joint Insured. But the content of the clause does not go as far as to say that all those insured have joint interests or are joint contractors. Rather it deals with some specific points which arise under another issue.
. That, it is true, was not a case of non-disclosure but of wilful misconduct by one of two persons insured. But in our opinion the principle that the innocent party can still recover if it is a separate insurance must equally apply.
 17. A contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith, and, if the utmost good faith is not observed by either party, the contract may be avoided by the other party.
 Mr. Rokison's submission is that section 18(1) is merely an example of the general duty that is placed on both parties, at all times, by section 17. We can see force in that argument. But it is questionable whether in practice the law has been treated in that way. 
 The origin of the order to ships' papers goes back to the time of Lord Mansfield. In those days the courts of common law did not give discovery of documents. If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.  In consequence partly of this inconvenience and partly of the fact that insurance has always been regarded as a transaction requiring the utmost good faith between the parties in which the assured is bound to communicate to the insurer every material fact within his knowledge not only at the inception of the risk, but at every subsequent stage while it continues, up to and including the time when he makes his claim, the common law courts invented the order for ship's papers, an order which is made as soon as the writ is issued in an action on a policy of marine insurance.
 illustrates such a situation in relation to the making and prosecution of a claim. Similarly, in the law of partnership there is a continuing duty of the utmost good faith.
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
 have been saying, as Mr Rokison submits, that the existence of such a duty would on the facts have been of no avail to the insurers in that particular case. But that does not detract from his view that there was no continuing duty.
 case (1922) 13 Ll.L. 75. In particular Lord Atkinson said (at p.79)
 ... it seems to us equally reasonable to suppose that it never could have entered into the contemplation of the parties that, after the servant's dishonesty in the service had been discovered, the guarantee should continue to apply to his future conduct, when the master chose for his own purposes to continue the servant in his employ without the knowledge or assent of the surety. If the obligation of the surety is continuing, we think the obligation of the creditor is equally so, and that the representation and understanding on which the contract was originally founded continue to apply to it during its continuance and until its termination.
, on the trustworthiness of the servant, so far as that was known to both parties, as soon as his dishonesty is discovered and becomes known to the master, the whole foundation for the continuance of the contract as regards the surety fails.
 In our judgment that doctrine does not apply to insurance contracts in general, or to fidelity insurance in particular, although the insurer may have some other remedy if the insured knowingly maintains in his employment a dishonest servant.
 This last issue is particularly difficult, largely owing to the obscurity of the contract wording. Despite the assistance of counsel we have found difficulty understanding the questions, let alone deciding them. 
 There was some discussion as to whether the clause was dealing with a possible claim to carry forward an unused limit or part of a limit from year 1 to year 2. That cannot have been contemplated, and one wonders whether the clause was designed or needed to prohibit it.
 However, the question remains whether the limit applies to all loss of the relevant insured in a particular policy year, or in some other way. 
 (a) the limit applies to all loss which flows from the conduct of a particular employee, even if he commits further dishonest and fraudulent acts in a later year which cause further loss, or
 (b) the limit applies to all loss caused by dishonest and fraudulent acts of a particular employee in the policy year in question, the loss being sustained or discovered in the policy period or the discovery period.
 With respect to loss caused by any person (whether one of the Employees or not) or in which such person is concerned or implicated or which is chargeable to any Employee as provided in Section 4 and which occurs partly during the Policy Period and partly during the period of other bonds or policies issued by the Company to the Insured or to any predecessor in interest of the insured and terminated or cancelled or allowed to expire and in which the period for discovery has not expired at the time any such loss thereunder is discovered, the total liability of the Company under this Policy and under such other bonds or policies shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount carried under the applicable Insuring Agreement of this Policy on such loss or the amount available to the Insured under such other bonds or policies, as limited by the terms and conditions thereof, for any such loss, if the latter amount be the larger.
That, as it seems to us, covers loss suffered partly during the period of one policy and partly in the period of another. It does not touch upon the present problem.
 All loss caused by acts committed by any person or in which such person is concerned or implicated and/or arising from any one occurrence (as set forth in Section II of the policy) will be considered a single loss for the purpose of this endorsement. If a loss is covered in part under this 
 policy and in part under a prior similar policy or bond superseded by this policy, the Deductible Amounts(s) applicable to such loss under this policy will be reduced by the amount of any deductible(s) actually applied to such loss under such other policy or bond.
 There remains a cross-appeal of the claimants, by leave of the judge, against his order for costs. This order was that the costs be reserved. He was apparently persuaded to take that course on the ground that it did not yet appear how relevant the preliminary issues would be to the ultimate result. We are afraid that we do not regard that as a good reason. The Insurers did not have to rely on the points which were raised as preliminary issues if they did not want to, instead of which the Insurers defended them (for the most part) here and below. As the price of failure, the costs below on the argument of preliminary issues should be paid by the Insurers in any event.
 We would not order that the costs should be taxed and paid forthwith. The parties should proceed to trial.
 (1) The information presented to the Insurers, via the brokers, comprised details of the turnover, locations, number of employees etc. of companies in the group, and also figures for the group wage roll, turnover and assets. It was presented in a package for the group as a whole. This was likely to lead to a smaller premium than one total for many insurances separately placed.
 It may well be that, when two persons are jointly insured and their interests are inseparably connected so that a loss or gain necessarily affects them both, the misconduct of one is sufficient to contaminate the whole insurance: Phillips on Marine Insurance, vol.i., at 235. But in this case there is no difficulty in separating the interest of the mortgagee from that of the owner.
, on the trustworthiness of the servant, so far as that was known to both parties, as soon as his dishonesty is discovered and becomes known to the master, the whole foundation for the continuance of the contract as regards the surety fails.
 Pergamon Group plc were the insured? If so, which? The expression and/or is very commonly used in describing who is insured under a policy - almost invariably, perhaps. But we doubt if it is used with lawyer-like precision. We would interpret it as saying, when the word insured is used in this document it may mean all of these companies, or else (depending on the context) it may mean any one of them. That is a perfectly sensible interpretation, although Mr Rokison says that it is too clever by half. For example, at the commencement of the policy it is said that
We do not see that this diversity of expressions is of any assistance to Mr Rokison in showing that the insured meant the Maxwell Group. The policy is not by any means written with the precision of an equity draftsman. Indeed we strongly suspect that it was not written by one person at all or at one time. It seems more likely that a number of hands have added or amended passages in it from time to time.
 At this point we feel that one should sit back and examine what we mean by the insured in an insurance contract. The expression in our view covers two aspects of the person described. First, he is the person with whom the insurer contracts, the party who is bound as such. Secondly he is the person who is interested in the property or other event covered by the insurance, and whose loss is to be made good if it occurs. For the first capacity the insured must, as it seems to us, be a natural or legal person. Mr Phillips referred us to the case of 
 (b) to obtain financial benefit for the Employee, or for any other person or organisation intended by the Employee to receive such benefit, other than salaries, commissions, fees, bonuses, promotions, awards, profit sharing, pensions or other employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment.
 The field of insurance may well be one where it is normal practice to make a preliminary contract, and then for one party (the insurers) to send detailed terms to the other, not expecting a reply unless the other regards them as unsatisfactory. This may be what happens in ordinary life with motor insurance or householder's comprehensive insurance. Often the necessary acceptance can be inferred when the insured, having received the proposed policy, pays the premium. We enquired whether that was a possible answer in the present case, but it seems that no such argument was put forward before the judge and the facts found in relation to the premium are insufficient.

The brokers, Willis Wrightson Ltd, would apparently have known that this was a reference to a form of policy used by Chubb. Next there was the slip, initialled by Chubb on 8th July 1990. Against the word FORM this said 
There is no direct evidence of any such form.  During the argument there were suggestions that WW might stand for Willis Wrightson, or for world wide. That must remain speculation. The slip also had the line CONDITIONS As per Primary Policy attached. That was the New Hampshire form of policy. 
That was the new name of Willis Wrightson.
  (ii) That was known to brokers such as Willis Wrightson.
  (iii) Willis Wrightson must be taken to have accepted that when they placed the business with Chubb.
There was evidence in support of points (i) and (ii) which was not in terms contradicted.  However, we were shown a letter dated 16th January 1991, to New Hampshire from Miss Godwin of the policy division at Willis Wrightson. It said in a postscript please could you send me one of your wdgs as I need to issue a Pol for 'Chub'. Miss Godwin did not give evidence.
 Fraud is not something absolute, existing in vacuo; it is a fraud upon someone. A man who tries to cheat his underwriters fails if they find him out, but how does his wrong against them invest them with new rights against innocent strangers to it?
 It is, we were told, common ground that there is a duty to disclose before a contract of insurance is concluded, before such a contract is renewed, and when a claim is made. But Mr Milligan for the Claimants except the pension interests submits that the situation on making a claim is conceptually different; non-disclosure then can only lead to the avoidance of a compromise agreement, if there has been one, or a right to recover money paid on the ground of mistake; it does not result in avoidance of the contract of insurance, unless there is fraud, or unless the contract says that it can be avoided for non-disclosure in making a claim.
 We regard it an unnecessary for us to express any opinion as to what rights, if any, arise from non-disclosure on making a claim.
 (1985) 1 Ll R 437. However, the surprise is tempered when one realises that, in the ordinary way, disclosure would be of little or no benefit to the insurer during the currency of a policy. Unless it happen before the contract is made, or before renewal, or (perhaps) before a claim is paid, disclosure could only fill the insurer with foreboding that he had made a bad bargain as a loss was likely to occur; he would have no right to cancel the contract of insurance on that account, although we suppose that he might be able to obtain reinsurance.
 It is said that the situation is different in this case, because the Insurers - and for that matter the insured - had a right of cancellation. It is enough to refer only to one of the provisions in that connection.
It is said that disclosure would be of value to an insurer when he has an unfettered right to cancel; hence there is a continuing duty of disclosure. The argument cannot, as we see it, be anything less than that the duty applies on every day of the policy period, to every material circumstance which becomes known to the insured. However, we suppose that if the new circumstance were something which led to a loss within fifteen days, it could be said that it was not material as the insurer would have no effective opportunity to cancel. 
It might be said that the Insurers in the present case are seeking to do exactly the same. Mr Rokison's answer is that here the Insurers were entitled to disclosure of any new information that had become available in order to determine whether to exercise their right to cancel. But the same could be said in the 
, this Court ought to extend (at least, so I understood him) the doctrine so as to meet a case of this kind, in order that the Underwriters should have the opportunity of giving the three months' notice when in fact the character or extent of the risk had altered. We asked him to formulate what the effect of introducing such a doctrine would be, and I think he must have felt himself in a difficulty in doing that, but ultimately I understood him to say that, if there was non-disclosure and an alteration of risk while the contract was a continuing contract, the Underwriter would have the right to exercise the option retrospectively when he became aware of the facts, as from the time when the disclosure ought to have been made, or alternatively, the contract should be treated as automatically concluded at the expiration of three months from that time. Well, I think that the statement of the consequences, which Mr Leslie Scott desires, indicate that this is not a case in which the doctrine can or ought to be applied. It may be that the Underwriters did not appreciate the difference in their position which they were making by the alteration in the form of the contract, and all I can say is that, if people enter into contracts of insurance for long periods, it would be a wise precaution to insert some provision requiring notice to be given them if the nature of the risk does alter or vary appreciably.
It seems to us clear that Bankes LJ was rejecting the submission that a continuing duty of disclosure existed by reason of the right to cancel. He may 
We would echo that sentiment. Whilst there are no doubt cases where a defence of non-disclosure is fully justified, there are also in our experience some where it is not. We should hesitate to enlarge the scope for oppression by establishing a duty to disclose throughout the period of a contract of insurance, merely because it contains (as is by no means uncommon) a right of cancellation for the insurer.
 We would answer this question by saying that there was no continuing duty of disclosure during the currency of any year of insurance by reason of the right to cancel. If and in so far as a contrary view was expressed in the

 We have not been told that there was any evidence of a custom in the insurance industry that policy details are accepted unless they are expressly questioned. Nor does there appear to have been any contention to that effect; it was merely said to be the usual practice as between Chubb and brokers. The judge did not regard the evidence of that as reliable. So we must consider the particular relationship and the particular circumstances of this case. We cannot attribute much, or indeed any, weight to the fact that Mr Ward wrote checked & okay on the letter, and put the policy in the place where original policies were kept; those were not circumstances which by inference conveyed acceptance to Chubb, since they did not know of them.

 What then of the second role of the Insured, as the owner of property or some other interest who will suffer loss if it is affected by an insured peril? On many occasions it may not make much difference whether the insured is the group, or the parent company, or the subsidiaries; all will ultimately have the same interest in the safety of the group's property. But on other occasions the interests will not be the same and ought to be insured separately. Some of the companies in the Maxwell group were publicly owned, although Mr. Maxwell had a controlling interest. It would, as it seems to us, have been a breach of duty by the directors of those companies if they had knowingly allowed the companies' property to be insured on terms which did not afford cover in the event of misconduct by companies in Mr. Maxwell's private ownership. The genesis or aim of the insurance contract was, we think, accurately stated by the judge:
 With respect to loss caused by any person (whether one of the Employees or not) or in which such person is concerned or implicated or which is chargeable to any Employee as provided in Section 4 and which occurs partly during the Policy Period and partly during the period of other bonds or policies issued by the Company to the Insured or to any predecessor in interest of the insured and terminated or cancelled or allowed to expire and in which the period for discovery has not expired at the time any such loss thereunder is discovered, the total liability of the Company under this Policy and under such other bonds or policies shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount carried under the applicable Insuring Agreement of this Policy on such loss or the amount available to the Insured under such other bonds or policies, as limited by the terms and conditions thereof, for any such loss, if the latter amount be the larger.

 Potter J had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt that there were likely to be situations whereby an officer of Company A, as well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the affairs of Company C and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or obligations of good faith in respect of all three. We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.
 The plaintiff seeks to strike out pars 15 to 16 inclusive of the first defendant's amended defence. In essence, by those paragraphs, the first defendant, an insurer, seeks to avoid liability under a policy of insurance on the basis that, during the currency of the policy the insured failed to comply with its obligation to act in good faith by failing to disclose certain material facts. It is claimed by the insurer that the disclosure of the facts was required by it in order to enable it to exercise two alternatives which were available to it. First, under condition D(v), the insurer had the opportunity of giving thirty days notice to terminate the policy. Secondly, it had the opportunity throughout of obtaining facultative reinsurance. It is said that the disclosures, if made, would have borne materially on a decision whether or not either or both of these opportunities should be availed of.
 was concerned with an express obligation in the policy to supply information if trading in an excluded zone.
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters.

 To the best of my knowledge I did not receive a copy of the Chubb excess layer wording for the subsequent policy year, namely, July 1991/June 1992. I am advised by Messrs Norton Rose, that they have reviewed all of the documents in the cabinet of original insurance policies and they have been unable to find any original or copy of the Chubb policy wording for the 1991/92 policy year, although the original for the previous year, together with the original letter dated the 13th February 1991 from Willis Corroon is contained in the cabinet.
The reason that the words (herein called the insured) appear to be out of place is that they are part of the pre-programmed wording into which details are subsequently inserted. (The days have unfortunately gone when one could tell at a glance how much of a document was printed for general use and how much typewritten for a specific purpose.)

 The present dispute arises out of a number of contracts of insurance concluded for years beginning on 1st August 1988, and 1st July 1989, 1990 and 1991. As commonly happens the contracts were arranged in layers: first there was a contract with a limit of Â£1 million, subscribed by New Hampshire Insurance Company alone; above that there were a succession of layers up to the following totals -
New Hampshire were the leading underwriters on all contracts, except for the top Â£10 million layers in 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, which were subscribed only by Chubb Insurance Company of Europe SA. Other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyds, who are the second to twenty-sixth plaintiffs in action 1993 folio 440, subscribed the contracts except for those written by New Hampshire or Chubb alone. It is not possible to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendants, as there are two actions and for the most part the same parties feature on opposite sides. So we will refer to all the insurers collectively as the Insurers, and as the Other Insurers when we are excluding Chubb. The beneficiaries of the insurance contracts were on one view companies in the Maxwell group, together with some pension fund trustees, and on another the Maxwell group itself. It is the companies, or rather some of them, and the trustees who feature as parties in these actions. They have been called the Claimants. As has already been mentioned, in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone.
 The insurance cover at the first layer was on the form of New Hampshire, headed Comprehensive Dishonesty, Disappearance and Destruction Policy Form A. All subsequent layers were on the same form, save that there is a dispute when it comes to the Chubb contracts. In broad terms it is an insurance against crime. The first part of the cover, and that with which the present dispute is concerned, is defined as follows:
 Before the judge there was a good deal of evidence, both oral and in witness statements, by witnesses of fact and an expert. There was also some contest as to what was relevant and admissible on the topic of interpretation of the contracts, followed by an interlocutory appeal to this court comprising Staughton, Millett and Ward LJJ. In extempore judgments delivered on 15th June 1995 it is said that there was some slight divergence of view between them, and that Staughton LJ represented the middle ground. At all events the parties have been content to rely on that judgment. We would reiterate the four principles which it proposed relating to the material that is relevant to the interpretation of a written contract:
 (1) Nothing is relevant unless it was known to, or reasonably capable of being known to, both parties at the time when the contract was made. In particular, an undisclosed intention held 
 (4) Evidence of negotiations is not admissible. This is subject to some exceptions, such as a case of rectification, or if it is said that agreement was reached in negotiations as to the meaning of a particular term, or that the contract was made by a continuous process of agreeing some terms and then turning to consider others.
 This issue relates to what have been called Year 3 and Year 4 of the insurance. The question is whether Chubb's form of policy became, in each case, part of the contract for the top Â£10 million layer which Chubb insured.
 The pleading of Chubb as to how the two policies came to form part of the contracts is distinctly vague, and there was no request for Further and Better Particulars. But Mr Phillips on their behalf put his case in three ways. First he submitted that, when each of the slips was initialled by Chubb, it was implied in the terms thereby agreed that the Chubb Follow Form was part of the contract.
 We cannot accept that argument, if only for the reason that the implication would contradict the express terms of the contract. Each of the slips referred to a form; in our experience that is extremely common if not universal practice. In neither case was it the Chubb form. In those circumstances it cannot in our judgment be implied that the Chubb form was required by the contract that was concluded when the slips were initialled.
 Secondly it was submitted that, once a policy has been issued, its terms are conclusive evidence of the contract between the parties unless and until it is altered by the process of rectification. That can happen by agreement of the parties or by order of a court but not otherwise. And there has been no application for rectification in this case.
 (1992) 1 Ll R.7. But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties. In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it is rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy. That is not this case. Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to. The insurers cannot preempt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it. That was the reasoning of Potter J., and we agree with it. He also had something to say about the operations of Lloyd's Policy Signing Office, but with that we are not concerned in this case.
 The third submission of Mr Phillips is the most promising. It is that there was a variation, agreed to on the part of the insured by silence. Although in the case of Year 3 it may only have occurred after the contract had been in force for five months, presumably it was retrospective.
 That there can be acceptance so as to conclude a contract by silence in some circumstances is shown by the case of 
 It is clear that in ordinary insurance cases a policy may become a binding contract between an insured and insurers even though the insured has not seen or expressly assented to all the detailed terms of the policy, provided always that such terms are the usual terms of the insurers.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
 One cannot generalise on the point. It all depends on the particular contractual relationship and the particular circumstances of the case.
. (1877) 2 App Cas 666). But we feel that we should proceed with some caution before giving too large a licence to one party to a proposed contract to thrust terms on the other without his explicit approval.
 The field of insurance may well be one where it is normal practice to make a preliminary contract, and then for one party (the insurers) to send detailed terms to the other, not expecting a reply unless the other regards them as unsatisfactory. This may be what happens in ordinary life with motor insurance or householder's comprehensive insurance. Often the necessary acceptance can be inferred when the insured, having received the proposed policy, pays the premium. We enquired whether that was a possible answer in the present case, but it seems that no such argument was put forward before the judge and the facts found in relation to the premium are insufficient.
 Nevertheless we regard this as a borderline case. What determines the point, in our judgment, in favour of the Claimants is that the Chubb policy did not merely supplement what was in the slips; it contradicted them, since in each case the slip referred to a different form. In those circumstances we would require more than the evidence of silence that there is here to persuade us that acceptance by the insured should be inferred. Like the judge, we would answer issue (D) by saying that the Chubb forms of policy were not part of the terms of the contracts for the top layers in 1993 and 1994.
Mr Phillips in the course of his reply pointed out that it was and remains the pleaded case of the Claimants that the Chubb policy did form part of the contracts. How then were they allowed to procure a preliminary issue from Waller J., and to argue before Potter J. that the Chubb policy did 
 form part of the contracts? Apparently the parties agreed that there was no need for any amendments, at any rate for the time being. We do not feel that we should tolerate such a cavalier attitude. The Claimants should be required to amend their pleadings so as to delete assertions which they now themselves contradict.
 At this point we feel that one should sit back and examine what we mean by the insured in an insurance contract. The expression in our view covers two aspects of the person described. First, he is the person with whom the insurer contracts, the party who is bound as such. Secondly he is the person who is interested in the property or other event covered by the insurance, and whose loss is to be made good if it occurs. For the first capacity the insured must, as it seems to us, be a natural or legal person. Mr Phillips referred us to the case of 
 (1947) KB 685 as authority for the proposition that a trade union can be a party to a contract of insurance. However that may be, we do not see that something called a group can be a party to a contract, otherwise than as a contract with all of its members. See 
 Liability of unincorporated associations. An unincorporated association is not a legal person and therefore cannot sue or be sued unless such a course is authorised by express or implied statutory provisions as in the case of a trade union and a trustee savings bank. Nor can a contract be made so as to bind all persons who from time to time become members of such an association. But a contract purportedly made by or with an incorporated association is not necessarily a nullity. If the person or persons who actually made the contract had no authority to contract on behalf of the members they may be held to have contracted personally. On the other hand, if they had the authority, express or implied, of all or some of the members of the association to contract on their behalf, the contract can be enforced by or against those members as co-principals to the contract by the ordinary rules of agency.
 What then of the second role of the Insured, as the owner of property or some other interest who will suffer loss if it is affected by an insured peril? On many occasions it may not make much difference whether the insured is the group, or the parent company, or the subsidiaries; all will ultimately have the same interest in the safety of the group's property. But on other occasions the interests will not be the same and ought to be insured separately. Some of the companies in the Maxwell group were publicly owned, although Mr. Maxwell had a controlling interest. It would, as it seems to us, have been a breach of duty by the directors of those companies if they had knowingly allowed the companies' property to be insured on terms which did not afford cover in the event of misconduct by companies in Mr. Maxwell's private ownership. The genesis or aim of the insurance contract was, we think, accurately stated by the judge:
 That there can be a joint insurance by persons having a joint interest is, of course, manifest. If A and B are joint owners of property - and I use that phrase in the strict sense - an undertaking to indemnify them jointly is a true contract of indemnity in respect of a joint loss which they have jointly suffered. Again, there can be no objection to combining in one insurance a number of persons having different interests in the subject-matter of the insurance, but I find myself unable to see how an insurance of that character can be called a joint insurance. In such a case the interest of each of the insured is different. The amount of his loss, if the subject-matter of the insurance is destroyed or damaged, depends on the nature of his interest, and the covenant of indemnity which the policy gives must, in such a case, necessarily operate as a covenant to indemnify in respect of each individual different loss which the various persons named may suffer. In such a case there is no joint element at all.
 That, as it seems to us, is this case. The companies that formed the Maxwell group had separate interests to insure, and not a joint interest in the same property. That must have been known to the Insurers, in the light of the companies' disparate businesses and seeing that one of them was Mirror Group Newspapers. It is not clear why they adopted a different definition of the insured for Year 3 and Year 4. But that definition was still capable of referring to the companies rather than the group as parties to the insurance contract (as they must have been), and also as the owners of separate interests which were to be covered by insurance separately. That in our judgment was the intention of the parties, and the effect of the policies. It is true that there is in the policies a clause headed Joint Insured. But the content of the clause does not go as far as to say that all those insured have joint interests or are joint contractors. Rather it deals with some specific points which arise under another issue.
That would have needed consideration if those policies had been incorporated in the contracts; but they were not. The slips for Chubb in Year 3 and Year 4 had the same description of the insured, with very slight and immaterial variations, as the New Hampshire policies for those years.
 We agree with the judge that all the contracts of insurance were composite in nature, there being more than one insured and each being insured separately.
 In the light of our conclusion on issue (F), the answer to this question is in our judgment, No. Technically one ought to enquire whether for each layer in each year there was one contract, or as many contracts as there were companies insured. And if the former, can a contract be avoided for non-disclosure as against one or some of the insured, but not against others? We feel that we are relieved from the need to answer those questions by the authority of the House of Lords, in the passage already quoted from 
 It is, we were told, common ground that there is a duty to disclose before a contract of insurance is concluded, before such a contract is renewed, and when a claim is made. But Mr Milligan for the Claimants except the pension interests submits that the situation on making a claim is conceptually different; non-disclosure then can only lead to the avoidance of a compromise agreement, if there has been one, or a right to recover money paid on the ground of mistake; it does not result in avoidance of the contract of insurance, unless there is fraud, or unless the contract says that it can be avoided for non-disclosure in making a claim.
 (1985) 1 Ll R 437. However, the surprise is tempered when one realises that, in the ordinary way, disclosure would be of little or no benefit to the insurer during the currency of a policy. Unless it happen before the contract is made, or before renewal, or (perhaps) before a claim is paid, disclosure could only fill the insurer with foreboding that he had made a bad bargain as a loss was likely to occur; he would have no right to cancel the contract of insurance on that account, although we suppose that he might be able to obtain reinsurance.

 was that after the insurance contract was concluded the test should be
 There is no duty to disclose matters relevant to the making of the contract once the contract had been made; the time has then passed within which they must be disclosed. The later disclosure of later discovered facts would serve no useful purpose and, therefore, is not required. By contrast there can be situations which arise subsequently where the duty of utmost good faith makes it necessary that there should be further disclosure because the relevant facts are relevant to the later stages of the contract. The 
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
, this Court ought to extend (at least, so I understood him) the doctrine so as to meet a case of this kind, in order that the Underwriters should have the opportunity of giving the three months' notice when in fact the character or extent of the risk had altered. We asked him to formulate what the effect of introducing such a doctrine would be, and I think he must have felt himself in a difficulty in doing that, but ultimately I understood him to say that, if there was non-disclosure and an alteration of risk while the contract was a continuing contract, the Underwriter would have the right to exercise the option retrospectively when he became aware of the facts, as from the time when the disclosure ought to have been made, or alternatively, the contract should be treated as automatically concluded at the expiration of three months from that time. Well, I think that the statement of the consequences, which Mr Leslie Scott desires, indicate that this is not a case in which the doctrine can or ought to be applied. It may be that the Underwriters did not appreciate the difference in their position which they were making by the alteration in the form of the contract, and all I can say is that, if people enter into contracts of insurance for long periods, it would be a wise precaution to insert some provision requiring notice to be given them if the nature of the risk does alter or vary appreciably.
We would echo that sentiment. Whilst there are no doubt cases where a defence of non-disclosure is fully justified, there are also in our experience some where it is not. We should hesitate to enlarge the scope for oppression by establishing a duty to disclose throughout the period of a contract of insurance, merely because it contains (as is by no means uncommon) a right of cancellation for the insurer.
 It remains to consider two cases on what are called fidelity bonds or guarantees. It seems that these are given to an employer as a guarantee of the fidelity of an employee; and that non-disclosure of dishonesty of the servant after the contract is made does have an effect on the contract of suretyship. In 
 ... it seems to us equally reasonable to suppose that it never could have entered into the contemplation of the parties that, after the servant's dishonesty in the service had been discovered, the guarantee should continue to apply to his future conduct, when the master chose for his own purposes to continue the servant in his employ without the knowledge or assent of the surety. If the obligation of the surety is continuing, we think the obligation of the creditor is equally so, and that the representation and understanding on which the contract was originally founded continue to apply to it during its continuance and until its termination.
, on the trustworthiness of the servant, so far as that was known to both parties, as soon as his dishonesty is discovered and becomes known to the master, the whole foundation for the continuance of the contract as regards the surety fails.
That doctrine is evidently based on an interpretation of the contract, and on the law of suretyship, rather than on a duty of disclosure imposed from outside by the law as in the case of a contract of insurance. As Mr Phillips said, it arises under an implied term, and not from a duty of the utmost good faith. It was considered in the American case of 
 In our judgment that doctrine does not apply to insurance contracts in general, or to fidelity insurance in particular, although the insurer may have some other remedy if the insured knowingly maintains in his employment a dishonest servant.
 This last issue is particularly difficult, largely owing to the obscurity of the contract wording. Despite the assistance of counsel we have found difficulty understanding the questions, let alone deciding them. 
 We have referred to that case merely as a possible illustration of the problem that we face in the present appeals. We are being asked to answer preliminary issues, which Waller J. ordered to be tried in two actions in the Commercial Court. That was no doubt a very sensible procedure. But it is sometimes helpful to us to have some live facts to bear in mind, rather than the dry bones of a preliminary issue.
That seems to us the high point of Mr Rokison's argument, although it also detracts from his submissions relating to Year 1 and Year 2. As usual there is the problem with alterations, did the parties mean to clarify what they had said previously or to change it?
 What the underwriter was seeking to do in these two cases was to fix upon the assured a duty to volunteer information ex post facto concerning new matter, which had come to light after the conclusion of the policy, and which affected the risk already accepted. The key to these cases is I think to be found in the dictum of Lord Buckmaster in the Niger case that there is no duty on the assured to disclose circumstances arising subsequently which might show that the premium had been accepted at too low a rate. This in my judgment does not touch the problem with which the Court is concerned in the present case.
 The problem arises in the special case of loss caused by the same employee to two companies. That is specifically dealt with in section 11 - 
That, as it seems to us, covers loss suffered partly during the period of one policy and partly in the period of another. It does not touch upon the present problem.
 Potter J had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt that there were likely to be situations whereby an officer of Company A, as well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the affairs of Company C and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or obligations of good faith in respect of all three. We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.

It is said that disclosure would be of value to an insurer when he has an unfettered right to cancel; hence there is a continuing duty of disclosure. The argument cannot, as we see it, be anything less than that the duty applies on every day of the policy period, to every material circumstance which becomes known to the insured. However, we suppose that if the new circumstance were something which led to a loss within fifteen days, it could be said that it was not material as the insurer would have no effective opportunity to cancel.

  (iii) Willis Wrightson must be taken to have accepted that when they placed the business with Chubb.
 We have not been told that there was any evidence of a custom in the insurance industry that policy details are accepted unless they are expressly questioned. Nor does there appear to have been any contention to that effect; it was merely said to be the usual practice as between Chubb and brokers. The judge did not regard the evidence of that as reliable. So we must consider the particular relationship and the particular circumstances of this case. We cannot attribute much, or indeed any, weight to the fact that Mr Ward wrote checked & okay on the letter, and put the policy in the place where original policies were kept; those were not circumstances which by inference conveyed acceptance to Chubb, since they did not know of them. Furthermore Mr Ward was a subordinate member of the Risk Management Department, under Mr Cox who was the head of it and whose task it was to review the primary policy wordings.
The reason that the words (herein called the insured) appear to be out of place is that they are part of the pre-programmed wording into which details are subsequently inserted. (The days have unfortunately gone when one could tell at a glance how much of a document was printed for general use and how much typewritten for a specific purpose.)
 (1) The information presented to the Insurers, via the brokers, comprised details of the turnover, locations, number of employees etc. of companies in the group, and also figures for the group wage roll, turnover and assets. It was presented in a package for the group as a whole. This was likely to lead to a smaller premium than one total for many insurances separately placed.
 Mr. Rokison's submission is that section 18(1) is merely an example of the general duty that is placed on both parties, at all times, by section 17. We can see force in that argument. But it is questionable whether in practice the law has been treated in that way. 
 It is common ground, and stated both in section 1 of the policy and endorsement 3 (which replaces it) that the dishonest and fraudulent acts referred to in Insuring Agreement 1 must be Committed during the policy period. The question then is whether
 this court had to consider what system of law should determine who had the better title to some shares in Berlitz International Inc., a New York Corporation. The facts in that case, either proved or assumed, were as follows: Macmillan (the 11th defendants in one of the present actions) were a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxwell Communications Corporation plc, a company owned partly by the public and partly by Mr Robert Maxwell and his family; they had a majority holding in the shares of Berlitz; those shares were transferred out of Macmillan's name to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, who were owned and controlled by Mr Maxwell and his family; and then the shares were pledged to secure the debts of companies in the private ownership of Mr Maxwell and his family. Thus Macmillan suffered a loss and those latter companies received a gain, unless and until Macmillan succeed in recovering the shares or (since they have now been sold by agreement) their value.
 We have referred to that case merely as a possible illustration of the problem that we face in the present appeals. We are being asked to answer preliminary issues, which Waller J. ordered to be tried in two actions in the Commercial Court. That was no doubt a very sensible procedure. But it is sometimes helpful to us to have some live facts to bear in mind, rather than the dry bones of a preliminary issue.
New Hampshire were the leading underwriters on all contracts, except for the top Â£10 million layers in 1990/1991 and 1991/1992, which were subscribed only by Chubb Insurance Company of Europe SA. Other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyds, who are the second to twenty-sixth plaintiffs in action 1993 folio 440, subscribed the contracts except for those written by New Hampshire or Chubb alone. It is not possible to refer to the parties as the plaintiffs and the defendants, as there are two actions and for the most part the same parties feature on opposite sides. So we will refer to all the insurers collectively as the Insurers, and as the Other Insurers when we are excluding Chubb. The beneficiaries of the insurance contracts were on one view companies in the Maxwell group, together with some pension fund trustees, and on another the Maxwell group itself. It is the companies, or rather some of them, and the trustees who feature as parties in these actions. They have been called the Claimants. As has already been mentioned, in some of the Maxwell companies Mr Robert Maxwell and his family held a controlling interest but there was also ownership by the public; others were owned by Mr Maxwell and his family alone.
 It follows from what I have said that I would uphold the decision of the learned Deputy Judge on the first of the two bases relied on by him. If I am wrong about that, however, it seems to me that the learned Deputy Judge's decision should in the alternative be upheld on the second basis relied on by him. The plaintiff had the policy in her possession at the end of October, 1993. She raised no objection to it of any kind until some seven months later. While it may well be that in many cases silence or inactivity is not evidence of acceptance, having regard to the facts of this case and the history of the transaction between the parties as previously set out, it seems to me to be an inevitable inference from the conduct of the plaintiff in doing and saying nothing for seven months that she accepted the policy as a valid contract between herself and the first defendants.
 Potter J had a proviso or caveat in answering this question. He felt that there were likely to be situations whereby an officer of Company A, as well as exercising functions in Company B, would also have had knowledge of the affairs of Company C and/or the actions or intentions of its officers, of such a kind that he would have been under parallel duties of disclosure and/or obligations of good faith in respect of all three. We were not addressed on that point, and the judge's observations on it should stand.
 The origin of the order to ships' papers goes back to the time of Lord Mansfield. In those days the courts of common law did not give discovery of documents. If this was wanted the only means of getting it was by a Bill of Equity, and very often an action at law was delayed while the necessary proceedings in equity were taking their course.  In consequence partly of this inconvenience and partly of the fact that insurance has always been regarded as a transaction requiring the utmost good faith between the parties in which the assured is bound to communicate to the insurer every material fact within his knowledge not only at the inception of the risk, but at every subsequent stage while it continues, up to and including the time when he makes his claim, the common law courts invented the order for ship's papers, an order which is made as soon as the writ is issued in an action on a policy of marine insurance.
 What then of the second role of the Insured, as the owner of property or some other interest who will suffer loss if it is affected by an insured peril? On many occasions it may not make much difference whether the insured is the group, or the parent company, or the subsidiaries; all will ultimately have the same interest in the safety of the group's property. But on other occasions the interests will not be the same and ought to be insured separately. Some of the companies in the Maxwell group were publicly owned, although Mr. Maxwell had a controlling interest. It would, as it seems to us, have been a breach of duty by the directors of those companies if they had knowingly allowed the companies' property to be insured on terms which did not afford cover in the event of misconduct by companies in Mr. Maxwell's private ownership. The genesis or aim of the insurance contract was, we think, accurately stated by the judge:
 (1) Nothing is relevant unless it was known to, or reasonably capable of being known to, both parties at the time when the contract was made. In particular, an undisclosed intention held 
 (1992) 1 Ll R.7. But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties. In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it is rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy. That is not this case. Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to. The insurers cannot preempt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it. That was the reasoning of Potter J., and we agree with it. He also had something to say about the operations of Lloyd's Policy Signing Office, but with that we are not concerned in this case.

 We suppose that point (1) can perhaps be described as a surrounding circumstance. At all events, we ruled that evidence of it was admissible when the dispute was last before this court, although that may have been a rather generous view. We have a good deal more doubt about the admissibility of points (2) and (3). But that only mattered when we were considering whether to save the parties from unnecessary expense and the judge from unnecessary labour by excluding evidence from the start. All that is now of importance is to say, as we do, that nothing in points (1), (2) and (3) is of any assistance in helping us to decide whether the insured were the companies identified or described in the wording, or else the Maxwell Group.
 (1947) KB 685 as authority for the proposition that a trade union can be a party to a contract of insurance. However that may be, we do not see that something called a group can be a party to a contract, otherwise than as a contract with all of its members. See 
 Fraud is not something absolute, existing in vacuo; it is a fraud upon someone. A man who tries to cheat his underwriters fails if they find him out, but how does his wrong against them invest them with new rights against innocent strangers to it?
It is said that disclosure would be of value to an insurer when he has an unfettered right to cancel; hence there is a continuing duty of disclosure. The argument cannot, as we see it, be anything less than that the duty applies on every day of the policy period, to every material circumstance which becomes known to the insured. However, we suppose that if the new circumstance were something which led to a loss within fifteen days, it could be said that it was not material as the insurer would have no effective opportunity to cancel. 
 duty of disclosure is by the insured, and that it only applies before the contract is concluded (which could no doubt include the new contract which is made upon renewal). But the maxim that mention of one of two things excludes the other must be applied with caution when considering the draftsmanship of Sir Mackenzie Chalmers. His method of codification was, at any rate at times, to state the effect of rules decided by the courts, and not to pronounce upon points which had not been decided. 
 The evidence shows that this business of covering these goods has been carried on by some, at any rate, of these Underwriters for very many years, and that until comparatively recently the practice was to enter into a fresh cover every year, and, of course, as long as that was the practice every year, the assured came under the obligation, before he entered into a fresh contract, to make a disclosure of any material facts which had come into existence, or which were in existence, and which were material to be known to the Underwriters. But there came a time when, I suppose for convenience, the parties altered the character of the contract, and altered it probably to an extent that they did not appreciate. What they did was, instead of having a fresh cover every year, and a fresh contract every year, they provided that the existing contract should go on until terminated by three months' notice; and that, in my opinion, established a condition of things under which this obligation to make a disclosure ceased, because there was a concluded contract, and a contract which remained and continued a concluded contract until it was in fact put an end to; and if the obligation on the assured is only to disclose matters which have come into existence and are material to be known before the contract is concluded, then the doctrine has no application to this case. But Mr Leslie Scott contended, first of all, that this was an exceptional case, and although he could not quote any authority for his proposition, he suggested that the contract of insurance being 
 (b) to obtain financial benefit for the Employee, or for any other person or organisation intended by the Employee to receive such benefit, other than salaries, commissions, fees, bonuses, promotions, awards, profit sharing, pensions or other employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment.
any other person or organisation.

 (4) Evidence of negotiations is not admissible. This is subject to some exceptions, such as a case of rectification, or if it is said that agreement was reached in negotiations as to the meaning of a particular term, or that the contract was made by a continuous process of agreeing some terms and then turning to consider others.
 The process started with a quotation dated 2nd July 1990. Against the printed word 
 Secondly it was submitted that, once a policy has been issued, its terms are conclusive evidence of the contract between the parties unless and until it is altered by the process of rectification. That can happen by agreement of the parties or by order of a court but not otherwise. And there has been no application for rectification in this case.
 Before the judge there was a good deal of evidence, both oral and in witness statements, by witnesses of fact and an expert. There was also some contest as to what was relevant and admissible on the topic of interpretation of the contracts, followed by an interlocutory appeal to this court comprising Staughton, Millett and Ward LJJ. In extempore judgments delivered on 15th June 1995 it is said that there was some slight divergence of view between them, and that Staughton LJ represented the middle ground. At all events the parties have been content to rely on that judgment. We would reiterate the four principles which it proposed relating to the material that is relevant to the interpretation of a written contract:
 by one of the parties is not admissible for the purpose of interpretation.
The boundary of what may be considered surrounding circumstances, within principle (3), is unfortunately not easy to draw. All too often a great deal of evidence is produced under that head which is of little or no help to interpretation. The present case is no exception in that respect.
 Pergamon Group plc were the insured? If so, which? The expression and/or is very commonly used in describing who is insured under a policy - almost invariably, perhaps. But we doubt if it is used with lawyer-like precision. We would interpret it as saying, when the word insured is used in this document it may mean all of these companies, or else (depending on the context) it may mean any one of them. That is a perfectly sensible interpretation, although Mr Rokison says that it is too clever by half. For example, at the commencement of the policy it is said that
 If on the true interpretation of the policy the insured were a single entity called the Maxwell group, it would be very arguable that none of those three requirements would be satisfied in the case of a dishonest or fraudulent transfer between companies within the group. But we have held under issue (F) that that was not the case. Each of the companies was insured (A and B and C) as if it alone was the insured (A or B or C). In our judgment the answer to this question is, Yes.
That doctrine is evidently based on an interpretation of the contract, and on the law of suretyship, rather than on a duty of disclosure imposed from outside by the law as in the case of a contract of insurance. As Mr Phillips said, it arises under an implied term, and not from a duty of the utmost good faith. It was considered in the American case of 
 We can see no ground for the wide interpretation under (a), which in effect means that there is no new cover in respect of the employee in question although a premium is paid to renew the policy for a further year. Mr Rokison submits that the limit is expressed to be for any one loss, and that dishonest conduct of one employee is one loss. In our judgment if the Insurers wished to achieve that result it was for them to say so with at least a minimal degree of clarity. The provision that the limit shall not be cumulative from year to year can as well be read as saying that 
 The third submission of Mr Phillips is the most promising. It is that there was a variation, agreed to on the part of the insured by silence. Although in the case of Year 3 it may only have occurred after the contract had been in force for five months, presumably it was retrospective.
That would have needed consideration if those policies had been incorporated in the contracts; but they were not. The slips for Chubb in Year 3 and Year 4 had the same description of the insured, with very slight and immaterial variations, as the New Hampshire policies for those years.
 It is conceivable, bearing in mind the time period between renewal and the collapse of the Maxwell Group, that the 1991/92 wording would not have been received by the department prior to my leaving at the end of 1992. Possibly it was stuck in the system at Willis Corroon.
 (1985) 1 Ll R 437. However, the surprise is tempered when one realises that, in the ordinary way, disclosure would be of little or no benefit to the insurer during the currency of a policy. Unless it happen before the contract is made, or before renewal, or (perhaps) before a claim is paid, disclosure could only fill the insurer with foreboding that he had made a bad bargain as a loss was likely to occur; he would have no right to cancel the contract of insurance on that account, although we suppose that he might be able to obtain reinsurance.

 The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed. So should the Insurers' application for leave to appeal on certain aspects of the judge's rulings as to the admissibility of evidence. No argument was addressed to us in support of that application.
