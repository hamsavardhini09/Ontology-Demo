The 'X' proceedings are served on D, E & F before any of the 'Y' proceedings have been issued or served, but C is served later. Country 'X', under Article 21, declines (or suspends) jurisdiction in favour of country 'Y' of the action as between A & B and C; and country 'Y' will be under an obligation under Article 21 to decline jurisdiction in favour of country 'X' of the action as between D and A & B. The Appellants' extension of their argument suggests that country 'X', having given effect to Article 21, should then go on and treat itself as second seized for the purposes of Article 22 even though, as regards all the remaining parties and the totality of the litigation now before it, country 'X' is manifestly the country first seized and country 'Y' is clearly, on a party by party basis, the second seized (A & B and D) or not seized at all (A & B and E & F). The same applies to country 'Y': having retained the action as between C and A & B but not as between D and A & B, the question for country 'Y' becomes which country was first seized of litigation involving the common cause of action which gives rise to the risk of irreconcilable judgments - the Article 22 question. The answer must be country 'X'.

If the Plaintiffs' allegations are true (and on an earlier interlocutory application Steyn LJ has acknowledged that they are supported by prima facie evidence of a sophisticated fraud), those of the Defendants who were officers of the Plaintiffs were not acting openly and honestly as organs and for the benefit of the Plaintiffs, but secretly and dishonestly for their own personal benefit and in fraud of the Plain tiffs. Had such Defendants been only some of the persons who composed the organs of the Plaintiffs, it would have been clear beyond argument that in misappropriating the Plaintiffs' money they were not acting as organs of the Plaintiffs but in fraud of those organs.
